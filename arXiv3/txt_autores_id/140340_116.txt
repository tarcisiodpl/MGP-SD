The way experts manage uncertainty usually
changes depending on the task they are
performing. This fact has lead us to consider the
problem of communicating modules (task
implementations) in a large and structured
knowledge based system when modules have
different uncertainty calculi. In this paper, the
analysis of the communication problem is made
assuming that (i) each uncertainty calculus is an
inference mechanism defining an entailment
relation, and therefore the communication is
considered to be inference-preserving, and (ii) we
restrict ourselves to the case which the different
uncertainty calculi are given by a class of truth­
functional Multiple-valued Logics.

INTRODUCTION

Most expert system (ES) building tools with uncertainty
management capabilities provide a unique and global
method for representing and combining evidence.
Nevertheless, human experts usually change the way they
manage uncertainty depending on the task they are
performing. To be able to model this behaviour, an ES
building tool must allow to attach different uncertainty
calculi to the structures implementing the different tasks
(in modular ES shells the notion of task is usually
implemented as goal-oriented modules).However, tasks or
modules in a knowledge base are not independent one of
each other, they need to cooperate and communicate, as
human experts do when solving complex problems. This
can be shown in the following example.
A physician diagnosing a pneumonia could ask to a
radiologist about the results of a radiological analysis. The
simplest and more frequent type of communication is to
get an "atomic" answer like

"it is likely that the patient has a cavitation in
his left lung."
Then, to use this information in his own reasoning, the
physician must only interpret in his language the
linguistic expression likely used by the radiologist, and
perhaps to identify it with another uncertainty term, say
for example acceptab le, used by himself. But the
communication could have been richer than that "atomic"
answer, and consist of a more complex piece of
information. For instance, the radiologist could have
answered:

"if from a clinical point of view you are very
confident that the patient has a bacterial disease
and he is also inmunodepressed, then its nearly
sure he has a cavitation in his left lung."
As in the previous case, to use the radiologist information
the physician must again interpret it. However, this time
the interpretation can not be only a matter of uncertainty
terms (very confident, nearly sure) but also a matter of
way of reasoning, if he wants to make use of this
information in other situations (i.e., patients) which do
not match exactly the one expressed above.
Therefore, if in a knowledge base we have different
uncertainty calculi for different tasks (or modules), and
these modules need to communicate, a correspondence
between their uncertainty calculi must be established. To
model the first type of communication shown in the
example, in a modular ES shell only a way of translating
the languages of different uncertainty calculi, attached to
different modules, is required. However, to model the
second type of communication the correspondence is also
required to be made inference-preserving. The need to
preserve sometimes inferences through the communication
among tasks can be made clearer by means of another
little example from an existing expert system,
PNEUMON-IAl [Verdaguer, 1989], for the diagnosis of

pneumoniae. The module (task) Bacteria of this expert
system comprises the following rule:

[If a patient has leukopenia and left-deviation
then he has a bacterial disease, sure]
stating that the certainty about the bacterianicity of a
disease depends on the certainty of the facts leukopenia and
/eft-deviation, which are investigated in another module
named Laboratory. Let's suppose that these two modules
have different uncertainty calculi. Then we could have two
types of communication between them. A first possibility
is that Bacteria asks to Laboratory for the two facts,
translates the answers and makes its "and" combination to
conclude about bacterianicity. The second possibility is
Bacteria asks the certainty value of the non-atomic
sentence "leucopenia and /eft-deviation" and translates it.
In this last case the "and" combination of the certainty
values is performed in the Laboratory module, and the
result is afterwards translated to the Bacteria uncertainty
calculus and used to conclude about bacterianicity. It
seems clear that in order to keep the coherence of the
whole diagnosis task, the certainty degree of bacterianicity
found out in each case should be the same. To make this
sure, the correspondence between the uncertainty calculi of
those modules should preserve the inferences made in the
Laboratory module when moving to the Bacteria module.
The general problem of analyzing conditions under which
a correspondence or communication between different
tasks with different uncertainty calculi preserves inference
is a very hard one. In order to deal with this problem,
several approaches could be taken into account, from pure
logical ones to more cognitive ones. In [Meseguer, 1989],
in another but not very different setting, it is argued that

"if the approach taken lacks a logical basis to serve as a
criterion of correctness the result may be quite ad hoc and
unsatisfactory, and it will probably involve a good deal of
costly engineering trial and error". Following this

argument, the approach we have chosen is a logical one,
but without forgetting cognitive aspects. More concretely,
our analysis will be carried out from two main points:
- first, we will consider uncertainty calculi as inference
mechanisms defining logical entailment relationships.
Therefore, correspondences (or communications) between
different uncertainty calculi will be analyzed as mappings
between different entailment systems.

interactive algorithm for defining such inference
preserving correspondences is proposed. This algorithm
has been thought as a mechanism to support human
experts when developing applications.

ENTAILMENT SYSTEMS

Inference engines of many rule-based ES can be considered
as implementations of proof calculi (from a set of axioms
and a set of inference rules) of some underlying Logical
Systems. As it is known, every logical system should
have a syntactical and semantical formalizations. The
theories of Institutions and Entailments Systems allow to
formalize an intuitive notion of logical system from the
model and proof theoretic approach point of view
respectively ([Goguen and Burstall, 1983], [Meseguer,
1989], [Harper et a!., 1989]). In this way the Institution
approach takes the satisfaction relation between models
and sentences as basic whereas the Entailment System
approach takes the entailment relation.
The communication problem among tasks or modules has
been introduced as the problem of defining inference
preserving mappings. Therefore, in this paper we focus
our attention in the entailment systems approach rather
than in the Institutions one, and thus, we are mainly
interested in correspondences between different entailment
systems.
Although a categorical definition of Entailment Systems
has been given [Meseguer, 1989], for our purposes an
Entailment System will consist of a pair (L, /-), where L
is a language (a set of sentences, usually built from a set
of connectives and a signature that provides a set of sorted
symbols), and/- is an entailment relation on zLxL, i.e. a
relation satisfying the following properties:
El.- reflexivity: for any sentence E, {E}I- E
E2.- mono tonicity: if r 1- E and r � r' then r• 1- E
E3.- transitivity: if r 1- Ei, for iE I and
ru{Ei, iE I} 1- E then r 1- E,

where r and r' are sets of sentences, and E and Ei are
sentences of L.
In [Meseguer, 1989] the following notion of a map of
entailment systems has been proposed.

- and second, we will use finite truth-functional multiple­
valued logics (MY-logics, for short) as uncertainty calculi,
as long as this is a simplified view of the uncertainty
reasoning model that our laboratory has been working
with in developing applications with the MILORD
system [ Sierra, 1989], mainly in the medical diagnosis
field.

Definition 2.1. (map of entailment systems)
Given the entailment systems (L, /-) and (L', /-' ), a
mapping H:L-->L' is said to be a map of entailment
systems if the following condition
If T/- E then H(T) /-' H(E),
holds for all set of sentences rand for all sentence E of L.
The map H is said to be conservative if r/- E whenever
H(T)/-' H(E).

The paper is structured in the following way. After this
introductory section, in section two there is a general
overview on entailment systems and their inference­
preserving mappings. In section three, we describe the
class of finite truth-functional multiple-valued logics we
will use as uncertainty calculi for different tasks. Section
four is devoted to a detailed study of inference-preserving
mappings for our uncertainty calculi, and finally, an

A map between entailment systems allows to preserve
inference in a strict sense. In partiCular, when the map is
conservative one entailment system is an extension of the
other one. However these strong conditions sometimes
can be weakened in the uncertainty reasoning framework.
From the point of view of the correspondence problem
between different tasks with different uncertainty calculi,
when a task imports information from another task, it

doesn't need always to deduce exactly the s ame
_
conclusions as the previous one could deduce. Sometimes
it only needs that its conclusions be coherent with the
_
deduction system of the other task . In other words, It
allows its reasoning to be less accurate when dealing with
the other task information, but not incorrect in any case.
To model this last situation a definition weaker than the
conservative one is introduced below. We will call it weak
conservative.
Definition 2.2. (weak con servative map).
Given entailment systems (L, /-) and (L' , /- ') a map H
from L to L ' is called weak conservative if the following
condition holds:
If H(r) J- ' E' then there exists a sentence Eof L
such that Tj- Eand H(E) f-'E'

for all set of sentences r of L and all sentence E'of L '.
If H is also a map of entailment systems we call it weak
conservative map .

A C LASS OF MULTIPLE-VALUED
LOGICS FOR THE UNCERTAINTY
MANA GEMENT IN RULE-BASED
EXPERT SYSTEMS

Taking the uncertainty management of MILORD as a
reference, in this section we consider a restricted type of
MV -logics which are expressive enough to model the
uncertainty reasoning used in many rule-based systems.
The uncertainty management approach used in MILORD
has the following characteristics [Godo et al., 1989]:
1) The expert defines a set of linguistic terms expressing
uncertainty corresponding to the verbal scale he will use
to weight facts and rules.
2) The set of linguistic terms is supposed to be ordered, at
least partially, according to the amount of uncertainty they
express, being always the booleans 'true' and 'false' their
maximum and minimum elements respectively.
3) The combination and propagation of uncertainty is
performed by operators defined over the set of linguistic
terms, basically conjunction, disjunction, negation and
detachment operators. A method for the elicitation of these
operators from the expert has been proposed in {Lopez de
Mantaras et al., 90). The main difference of this approach
with respect to other ones is that no underlying numerical
representation of the linguistic terms is required.
Linguistic terms are treated as mere labels. The only a
priori requirement is that these labels should represent an
ordered set of expressions about uncertainty. For each
logical connective, a set of desirable properties of the
corresponding operator is listed. Many of thes� propertie�
are a finite counterpart of those of the uncertamty calcuh
based on t-norms and t-conorms, which are in turn the
basis of the usual [ 0,1)-valued systems underlying Fuzzy
Sets Theory [Alsina et al., 1983]. The listed properties act
as constraints on the set of possible solutions. In this
way, all operators fulfilling them are gener ated: This
_
approach has been implemented by formulating
1t as a
constraint satisfaction problem [Godo and Meseguer,
1991]. Finally, the expert may select the one he thinks

fits better his own way of uncertainty management in the
current task.
These characteristics make clear that the logics associated
to the different MILORD uncertainty calculi are a class of
finite multiple-valued logics, taking the linguistic terms
as truth-values and the operators as the interpretations of
the logical connectives. In other words, each linguistic
term set, together with its set of operators, defines a truth­
values algebra and therefore a corresponding multiple­
valued logic. In (Agusti-Cullell et al., 1990), MV-logics
have been analyzed from the semantic point of view and
formalized as families of Institutions.
Following that line, the main characteristics of our MV­
logics for uncertainty management we are concerned with
are given by:
- An algebra of truth-values: a finite algebra A =
<An , 0, 1, N, T, l> such that:
1) The set of truth-values An is a chain2 represented by
0 = ao < a1 < ...< an-! 1,
where 0 and 1 are the booleans False and T r u e
respectively.
2) The negation operator N is an unary operation such
that the following properties hold:
N1: if a < b then N(a) > N(b)
N2: N 2 = Id.
3) The "and" operation T is any binary operation such
that the following properties hold:
Tl: T{a,b)=T(b,a)
T2: T(a,T(b,c)) = T(T(a,b),c)
T3: T(O,a)=0
T4: T(1,a) = a
TS: if a :<>b then T(a,c) i> T{b,c) for all c.
Note that in the unit interval these properties define
t-norms functions if we add the condition of
continuity.
4) The implication operator I is defined by residuation
with respect to T,.
I(a,b) = Max{ c E An such that T(a,c) :5 b}
i.e., I is the finite counterpart of an R-implication
generated by the "and" operator T [Trillas and Valverde,
1985].
- A set of Connectives: "not"(--,), "and"(&) and
"implication"(-->)
- A set of Sentences: sentences are pairs of classical-like
propositional sentences and intervals of truth-values. The
classical like-propositional sentences are built from a set
of atomic symbols and the above set of connectives.
However the sentences we will consider through this case
study are only of the following types:
(pJ, V),
(P! & P2 & ... & Pn , V),
(PI & P2 & & Pn --> q, V),
where pJ, ... , Pn are literals (atoms or negations of
atoms), q is an atomic sentence and V is a subset of truth­
values. For each truth-values algebra A, LA will stand for
=

···

2 Usually the set of truth-values An stands for a totally ordered set of
linguistic terms that the expert uses to express uncertainty, but
nothing changes if it is only partially ordered.

the set of sentences with intervals of truth-values

-Models : are defined by valuations, i.e. mappings p
from to the firsts components of sentences to An provided
that:
p(-,p) = N( p(p) )
P(Pl & pz) = T( P(Pl), P(P2) )
p(p --> q) = I(p(p), p(q))
- Satisfaction Relation: between models and
sentences is defined by:
Mp I= (p, V) if, and only if p(p) E V,
where Mp stands for the model �e�ined by a valuation p.
- Entailment Relation: the rmmmal one generated by
1) the following set of axioms:
(A-1 ) ((p1 & pz)&p 3 --> P1& (pz & p3), 1)
(A- 2) (p1 & (pz& p3) --> (p1 &P2)& p3, 1)
(A-3) (pl& pz-->pz& pl , 1)
(A-4) (-,-,p-->p, 1)
2) the following inference rules, which are sound with
respect to the satisfaction relation (Agusti-Cullell et
a!., 1990):
(RI-1 ) WEAKENING: 1, (p, V) I- (p, V'),
where V c;;;; V' and 1 is a set of sentences,
(RI-2) NOT-introduction: (p, V) 1- (-,p, N(V)),
(RI-3) AND-introduction:
(Pl· Vl ), (P2, Vz) 1- (Pl & pz, T (V1, Vz)),
(RI-4) MODUS PONENS:
(p, V1), (p-->q, Vz) 1- (q, MP(V1, Vz)), being
if a and b are inconsistent
MP(a,b) = [ a,l], if b = 1
T(a,b), otherwise
where a and b are said to be inconsistent if there exists
no c such that I(a,c) = b.

{0,

Notice that these inference rules are the only ones that an
inference engine would need when working on sets of
sentences of the above specified types, very common in
fact in rule-based ES. However, instead of the rule RI-4
and for the sake of simplicity, we will consider the
following inference rule:
(RI-4') MODIFIED MODUS PONENS:
(p, V1), (p-->q, Vz) I- (q, T(V1, Vz)).
Although it is correct for instance in the usual case of
upper intervals of truth-valu�s, this inference rule is �ot
logically sound in general with respect to the sem� n�1cs
.
(satisfaction relation) above defmed. Nevertheless, It IS a
well known fact that, from the cognitive point of view,
detachment operators share the same properties required to
conjunction operators [ Bonissone, 1987]. These
arguments, together with self-evident simplicity reasons,
have lead us to adopt the inference rule RI-4'. Therefore,
from now on, given a truth-values algebra A we will
denote by MVLA the multiple-valued logic defined above,
and by (LA, 1-A) its associated entailment system. The
language of this entailment system is LA and its
entailment relation is the minimal one determined by
axioms A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4, and by inference rules RI1, RI-2, RI-3 and RI-4'.

On the other hand, the disjunction operator needed for
parallel combination can be obtained from the negation
and conjunction operators using the De Morgan laws. For
these reasons, and for deductive purposes, only the ordered
set of truth-values (linguistic terms) and the conjunction
and negation operators should be specified in the truth­
values algebra definitions. Therefore, from now on, truth­
values algebras will be represented by <A,T,N>, omitting
the booleans 0 and 1, as long as they belong to all
algebras.

INFERENCE P RESERVING
BETWEEN MV -LOGICS

MAPS

The aim of this section is to analyze the problem of
preserving inference in communicating modules,
assuming that each one has its own finite MY -logic as
uncertainty calculus. In section two, maps and weak
conservative maps of entailment systems have been
introduced in order to model inference preserving
correspondences. In the first subsection of this section, it
is shown that morphisms and quasi-morphisms of truth­
values algebras generate maps and weak conservative maps
respectively of the corresponding entailment systems. In
the second and third subsection, morphisms and quasi­
morphisms of truth-values algebras are studied. Finally, in
the fourth subsection an interactive algorithm to define
such mappings to assist human experts when developing
applications, is proposed.
4.1 WEAK CONSERVATIVE MAPS

Now we consider the problem of finding inference
preserving correspondences between two of these logics
MVLA and MVLB, where A= <An, T, N> and B = <Bm,
T', N'> are their corresponding truth-values algebras. As !t
has been noted in section 2, the mappings between therr
entailment systems (LA, I-A) and (LB,I-B) we are mainly
interested in are the weak conservative ones. In order to
give a sufficient condition for a mapping
f: An --> B m to generate a weak conservative
mapping between the entailment systems of MVLA and
MVLB, we need some new definitions and results:
Given a truth-values algebra A = <A11,T,N>, we consider
the set of intervals of A11, I(An)={[a,b]l a,b E An} where
[ a,b] = {x 1 x E A n. a � x � b }. We can define the
following order relation in I(An ):
I]� 1 2 ifa�b for all a E /]and for all b E f2.
Let's consider now the following operations on I(An)
1) N*([a,b]) [ N(b), N(a)]
2) T*([at.b1J,[a z,bzJ) = [ T(apz), T(bt.bz)J
It is easy to check that N* is a negation mapping and T*
fulfils T1+TS. Moreover, identifying every element a of
An with the interval [a,a] of I(An ), <An , T, N> is a
subalgebra of d(An ).T*,N*>, that is, we have the
following proposition.
=

Combining Multiple-valued Logics in a Modular Expert Systems

Proposition 4.1. Any truth-value algebra<An. T, N>
can be extended to an algebra<I(An ). T*, N* > of the
same type that has<An, T, N> as a subalgebra.
It is worth noticing that (I(An), �*) is only a partial
ordered set with minimum 0 [0,0] and maximum 1 =
[1,1], and N* and T* are univocally defined by N and T.
Next we give a small example of an algebra of intervals
generated by a truth-values algebra of four elements

{0 < a < b < 1} the chain of four
elements. The set of intervals of A is I(A)= {[O,a], [O,b],
[0,1], [a,b], [a,l], [b,l], [0,0], [a,a], [b,b], [1,1] }.
Identifying every interval [x,x] with the element x of A,
the order relation on A and I(A) can be represented by the
graphs of figure 1.

<A n . T, N> and B <Bm. T', N'> respectively. Then
every quasi-morphism of A to B generates a weak
conservative mapping between the entailment systems of
MVL A and MVLs.
=

Proof. Let f: An --> I(B m ) be a quasi-morphism
between A and B, and let r {(pr, Vl), ..., (pn, Vn)} a
set of sentences of MVLA. We will denote by H f the
translation function from MVLA to MVLa defined by
H f((s,V)) = (s,f(V)).Obviously H f translates axioms of
MVLA into axioms of MVLa. Suppose that in MVLa a
sentence E' (q, V') can be derived from Hf(r) = {(Pl .
f(Vl)), ..., (pn, f(Vn))} and axioms of MVLa by applying
a sequence of RI-1, RI-2, RI-3 and RI-4' inference rules
and let's denote by g' the composition of their
corresponding inference functions (only functions N' and
T' will appear). Then it must be the case that g'(f(V 1), ...,
f(Vn )) c V'. We have to show that there exists a sentence
E of MVLA such that it can be derived from r 1-A E and
thatHf(E) 1-B E'. Let E be the sentence (q, g(Vr, ..., Vn)),
where g is the function obtained from g' replacing the
occurrences of N' and T' by N and T. Then it is clear that
rI-A E holds and, because f is a quasi-morphism, we have
f(g(Vr, ... , Vn)) c g'(f(V l ), ... , f(Vn )) c V', soH f(E) 1-B
E' also holds and the theorem have been proved. •

In the particular case of algebra morphisms, the following
proposition shows that they also generate maps of
entailment systems.
Proposition 4.3. Let MVL A and MVLB be the
multiple-valued logics defined on the truth-values algebras
A =<An, T, N > and B <Bm , T', N'> respectively. Then
every order-preserving morphism of A to B generates a
map between the entailment systems of MVLA and
MVLB.

Figure 1: Graphs of the order relation of A and I(A).
Next we introduce what we call a quasi-morphism of
algebras as a weakened notion of morphism, allowing to
map values of an algebra into intervals of the other. This
tries to capture the possibility of being imprecise when
renaming truth-values from a MV-logic to another.
Definition 4.1. Given two truth-values algebras A =
< A n , Tj, Nj> and B =<Bm, T2, N2>. a mapping
f : A n --> I(Bm) is a quasi-morphism from A to B if
the following conditions hold:
l ) f is non-decreasing, i.e. ifa :5 b , then f(a ) f> f(b),
2) f (O ) = 0,
3) f ( N J(x) ) = N2* ( f(x) ),
4) f( TJ(x,y) ) c T2*(/(x)f(y)),
It is clear from this definition that :
(i) algebra morphisms are a particular case of algebra
quasi-morphisms, identifying every element b of B with
the interval [b,b]. Moreover, a quasi-morphism f is a
morphism if, and only if, f(Am) c Bm.
(ii) algebra morphisms from <A n, T1, N 1> to
<l(Bm), T1*, Nz*> are also quasi-morphisms.
Theorem 4.2. Let MVLA and MVLB be the multiple­
valued logics defined on the truth-values algebras A

MORPHISMS OF TRUTH-VALUES
ALGEBRAS

In this subsection we tum our attention to the problem of
relating truth-values algebras by means of order-preserving
mappings which are algebra morphisms, and some
necessary and/or sufficient conditions for their existence
are given. Although there can exist algebra morphisms
which are not order-preserving, for cognitive and logical
reasons it seems reasonable to require this condition.
Therefore, as long as we are only interested in order­
preserving mappings, from now on, and for the sake of
simplicity, we will use the term morphisms as an
abbreviation of order-preserving morphism with f(O)=0.
We begin with some well-known results on negation
operators. For each chain A0, there exists only one
negation N and it is defined by
N(ai) = an-i-1·
Then every chain A0 can be partitioned in three subsets:
- the set of negative elements Nn ={xI x < N(x)}
- the set of fixed elements :Fn={xI x N(x) }
=

- the set of positive elements Pn={xI x > N(x) }

21

22

being these subsets :F'n= { ak }, Nn = { ai I kk }, P n =
{ ai I i>k }, if n =2k+1, and :F'n= 0, Nn = { ai I kk} and
= { ai I i�k }, if n=2k.
The following equalities also hold: N(Nn) = Pn,
N(:F'n) = :F'n and N(Pn)= Nn.

Pn

Proposition 4.4. Given two chains An and Bm . a
mapping f: An --> Bm is a morphism with respect to
the negation operator if, and only if, the following
conditions hold:
1.f;Nn is an order preserving mapping from Nn to

Nmu1'm such that f(O)
0
2.f(1'n) F'm
3.1f ai belongs to Pn.J(ai) = N'(j(an-i-1)), where N ' is
the negation associated to Bm.
=

=

From this proposition it is easy to show that:
- If n is odd then, in order to be f a morphism, m must
be also odd, as long as f(:F'n) = :F'm # 0.
- In the case of being n even or both n and m odd,
every mapping ft: Nn --> Nmu:F'm defines a negation
morphism/in the following way:
if a i E N n
f1 (ai),

{

if a r E :F' n and :F' m = {br }
f(ai)= br ,
N'(f1 (N(ai))), if a i E P n
and reciprocally, every negation morphism/ is defined by
the mapping f1 = fiN n·

We follow now with two propositions about how "and"
operations can defined in order to have algebra morphisms.
Proposition 4.5. Let< An , N, T > be a truth-values

algebra and let Bm a chain containing An such that the
negation N' associated to B fulfils N'jAn = N, i.e. if ai =
bj then N (ai) bm-j-1· Then there exists at least an "and"
operation T' on Bm such that<An. N, T> is a subalgebra
of< Bm . N ', T' >.
=

Proof It can be easily checked that the mapping T' defined
as:
T(p-,q- ) if p # 1 and q # 1
:
T ,(p,q)
If q = 1
p,
q,
if p = 1
where p- =max{ x E An I x :S p }, is an "and" operation
on Bm , and that it also verifies T'IAnxAn= T. •

{

=

Proposition 4.6. Let <An . T, N> be a truth-values
algebra and letf: An --> Bm be a negation morphism.
Then there exists an "and" operation T' on Bm such that f
is an algebra morphism if, and only if, f is compatible
with T, that is, for all a,b,c,d E An,fa
( ) =f (b) andf(c) =
f(d) imply f(T (a,c)) f(T(b,d)).
=

Proof. Obviously, if f is an algebra morphism it is
compatible with T. On the other hand, if f is compatible
with T, the relation =f defined as
a =f b ifbEF f(a) = f(b)
is a congruence relation on An. Let < A nl=f , Tf, Nf> be
the quotient algebra. Therefore, identifying An/=f with

f(An). f will be a morphism from <An , T, N> to < f(An),
Tf, Nf>. By proposition 4.5 there exists T' on Bm such
that < f(An). T f, Nf> is a subalgebra of <Bm , T', N'>,
where N' is the negation associated to Bm. •
Now, taking into account the above results, it is
interesting to point out some considerations about the
problem of algebra morphism generation. In the following
A will stand for a truth-values algebra <An , T, N> and
Bm for a chain of m elements.
1) If n is odd and m even, there is no possible morphism
between A and B, being B any truth-values algebra defined
on Bm. Then, this case will not be considered any more.
2) In order to define a morphism f: An --> Bm with
respect to the negation operator we only need to take any
mapping fi: Nn --> N m u:F' m with f1 (0) 0 and to
extend it in the way above indicated.
=

3) The generation of possible operations T' on Bm .
together with renaming mappings f from An to Bm such
that f: <An. T, N> --> <B m , T', N'> are morphisms,
is a process that can be automated without difficulties.
The problem reduces to:
- first, to generate all mappings f from all order

preserving mappings f1: N n --> N mu:F'm with
f1(0) =0,
- second, to check which ones are compatible with T,
- and third, to generate all algebras B m containing
f(Am) as subalgebra.
This method will provide us with a family of suitable
algebras <Bm. T', N'> for each mapping f1.
4) Nevertheless, in general, it can be the case that the set
of possible solutions would be empty. As an example,
consider the algebra <A.4,T,N>, where A4 ={O<al<az<l},
and the "and" operation T is the one given in figure 2.

It is easy to check that there exists no renaming mapping
from A4 to B3 such that a morphism between <A4,T,N>
and <B3, T', N'> can be defined for any "and" operation
T'. Let B3 = {O<b<l}, and thus N '= {0}, :F''= {b}, and
P'={1}. It is clear that if f1 :{0,a1} --> {O,b} is order­
preserving and f 1 (0) = 0, then there are only two
possibilities:
1) f1(a1) = 0, and then the mapping f: A4--> B3 is
defined by f(O) = f(a1 ) and f(az) = f(1) = 1, but f is not
compatible with T, because f(az) = f(l) but f(T(az,az)) =
0 * 1= f(T(az,1));

QUASI-MO RPHISMS OF
TRUTH-VALUES ALGEBRAS

As we have seen in last section, given any truth-values
algebras A and B, it is not always possible to find a
morphism between them. However, this is not the case of
quasi-morphisms because of the additional freedom of
mapping (or renaming) a truth-value of A to an interval of
B. This point is proved in the following proposition.
Proposition 4.7: Let A = <An. TJ, NJ> and B <Bm.
Tz, Nz> be two truth-values algebras. Let C =<Cko T',
N'> be an algebra that can be imbedded in both A and B,
and let h1 and hz their corresponding monomorphisms.
Then there exists at least one quasi-morphism f from A to
B such that f(hz(c)) hz(c), for a/1 c E Ck.
=

Figure 3. "And" operations in chains of five and seven
elements

It can be checked that there is no morphism from A to B.
On the other hand C = <C3, T'', N">, being C3={0<b<l}
and T"(x,y) = min(x,y), is the maximal subalgebra that
can be imbedded into A and B, and the monomorphisms
h1 and h2 are defined by:
hz(O)=o
h 1( 0) o
hz(b)=b3
h1(b)=a2
h1(1)=1
hz <O =1
respectively. The above proposition 4.7 assures that the
mapping f: As-> I(B7) defined by:
f(O)=0
f(ai) [O,b3]
f(az) b3
f(a3) = [b3,l]
f(l) 1
is a quasi-morphism from A to B.
=

=

=

=

=

Proof. First of all, notice that given A and B there always
exists the algebra C, because at least the algebra of
booleans satisfies the required condition for any pair of
truth-values algebras. So, let h1 and h z be the
corresponding monomorphisms from C to A and B
respectively, and consider the mapping f: A n --> l(Bm )
defined by:
f(x) = [ h2(Cx-), h2(Cx+) l
where ex-=max{c of Ck 1 h l (c)$x} and ex+= min { c
of Ck 1 h1 (c) � x }. Straightforward computation shows
that the required properties for f to be a quasi-morphism
hold.•
As an example, let's consider the algebras A = < As, T,
N> and B = <B7, T', N'>, where the "and" operations T
and T' are given in figure 3 respectively.

P R AGMATICS OF INFERENCE
PRESERVING MAPPINGS

In the previous sections we have seen that when two
modules, that use different multiple-valued logical
languages, need to communicate, an inference preserving
mapping between their logics has to be defined. The
process of defining these mappings could be supported by
an interactive algorithm based on the notion of morphism
and quasi-morphism between truth-values algebras. This
process could be as follows:
Initially the expert determines a MV -logic for each
module, giving the set of truth-values and the "and" truth­
table, and proposes as many as needed renaming functions
between different truth-values sets. Then, for each pair of
modules having different MV -logics, the interactive
algorithm will take their truth-values algebras and the
renaming between them and check if the initial renaming
is an algebra quasi-morphism. If not, the algorithm
presents to the expert the set of possible modifications of
the renaming function, each one being a morphism or a
quasi-morphism. The expert may then select the one that
fits better his aims. If no selection is made, possible
modifications of the "and" truth-table are suggested,
keeping the initial renaming function. Finally, if there has
not been any solution, possible modifications of both
renaming and truth-table are suggested.
Next, we give an scheme of the algorithm in a Pascal-like
style. The notation used is the one of the previous
sections.

on Bm such that f be a quasi-morphism. The method for
finding "and" operations is the following:
1 . If f is not a negation morphism, it returns the
empty set.
2. Find all "and" operations T' on Bm.

3. Check if f is a quasi-morphism.
Remarks: A general algorithm for finding truth-values
algebras over a partially ordered set of n elements is given
in [Godo and Meseguer, 1991).

d) Renaming and truth-table generation: Let A
be a truth-value algebra and let B m be a chain of m
elements. Renaming and truth-table generation is a

function that, given An and Bm, returns pairs (T',f), where
T' is an "and" operation on Bm and f is a quasi-morphism
from A to <I(Bm),T'*,N'*>. In this case, the method for

finding pairs (T', f) is the following one:
1 . Define N'* on I(Bm).

2. Define all the possible functions f1 as in the case of
renaming generation.
3. For every f1, define the negation morphisms as in
the case of renaming generation.
4. Find all "and" operations T' on Bm.
5. Check if f is a quasi-morphism.

; c E C is selected by the expert
then return (A, (Bm, c), f)

;4: Renaming and "and" truth-table generation
RC = { (f, T') If: An-> I(Bm) and
quasi-morphism?(A, (Bm, T'), f) }

Final remarks:

print(RC)
if select((x, y))

; (x,y) E RC is selected by the expert
then return (A, (Bm , y), x)
else return nil

In the following a constructive description of predicates
and functions used in the algorithm is given.

a) Renaming checking: It is only a checking
predicate. It checks if a given function (renaming) is a
quasi-morphism from A to B, where A and B are two
given algebras.
b) Renaming generation: Let A and B be two truth­
values algebras. Renaming generation is a predicate that

returns all possible quasi-morphisms from the truth-values
algebra A to the interval algebra I(B). The method to find
these quasi-morphisms is the following:
1. Define the operations T'* and N'* on I(B).

2. Define mappings f 1 : N u :f'
such that f 1 (0)

f1 (x) I> f1 (y).

Remarks: The solutions, if any, contain as a particular
case all the possible morphisms from A to B. By
proposition 4.7, for every pair of algebras A and B, the
renaming generation set (A,B) is not empty.

c) "And" truth-table generation: Let A be a truth­
value algebra, let B m be a chain of m elements and let f
be a renaming function from A n to I(Bm ). "And" truth­
table generation is a predicate that returns "and" operations

1.- All these methods can be automated.
2.- Some of the functions can return the empty set. (see
examples of subsections 4. 2 and 4.3)
3.- An order of preference on the sets R, C and RC should
be given. There are many possibilities to do this. For
example, several distances with respect to the initial
renaming and truth-table operation can be defined on the
above sets to obtain preference orderings. It seems
reasonable that in all cases algebra morphisms should be
preferred to algebra quasi-morphisms.
4.- The complexity of the algorithm is exponential in the
number of truth-values. However, two factors make
acceptable the execution time of the algorithm: (i) the
number of different uncertainty linguistic terms used by an
expert is usually not greater then nine [Miller, 1967), and
(ii) the strong conditions required to "and" operations (see
section 3) restrict the combinatorial explosion in the
generation of such operations..

CONC LUSIONS A N D FUTURE
WORK

In this paper, the problem of communicating tasks with
different uncertainty calculi has been introduced in a very
general framework. This problem arises when dealing with
large knowledge-based systems in which a better
modelling of reasoning for different tasks requires working
together with different uncertainty reasoning systems In
the framework of rule-based expert systems, this problem
has been analyzed in detail in the particular case in which
different MY-logics are used to model the management of
uncertainty in different tasks. Necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for the correspondence mappings between them
to be inference preserving have been given. Also an
interactive algorithm to define such mappings has been

Combining Multiple-valued Logics in a Modular Expert Systems

proposed to assist the human expert in relating tasks or
modules by inference preserving correspondences.
However the general problem of communicating different
uncertainty reasoning systems is very complex, and
further research is needed as much in the field of
distributed knowledge based systems as in the case of
considering more complex models of uncertainty
reasoning systems.

Within the possibilistic approach to uncer­
tainty modeling, the paper presents a modal
logical system to reason about qualitative
(comparative) statements of the possibility
(and necessity) of fuzzy propositions. We re­
late this qualitative modal logic to the many­
valued analogues MVS5 and MVKD45 of the
well known modal logics of knowledge and be­
lief 55 and KD45 respectively. Completeness
results are obtained for such logics and there­
fore, they extend previous existing results for
qualitative possibilistic logics in the classical
non-fuzzy setting.

INTRODUCTION

In the recent past, a lot of effort has been put in re­
lating numerical and symbolic approaches to uncer­
tain reasoning. Numerical formalisms attach degrees
of belief to propositions. Belief degrees are understood
as a measure on the set of possible worlds (possible
state descriptions) that assigns to every proposition
the measure of the set of worlds in which the proposi­
tion is true. Therefore, uncertainty measures are not
truth-functional, as it is welt known and established,
i.e. the measure of a compound formula can not be in
general obtained as a function of the measures of its
subformulas.
Possibilistic logic (cf. e.g. [Dubois & Prade, 88]) is
a particular numerical formalism based on the use of
the so-called possibility and necessity measures that
provide to what extent a crisp piece of knowledge can
be considered plausible and certain respectively. Even
if formulas bear numerical possibilities, we may be in­
terested not in the values themselves but only in their
comparison, i.e. in formulas such as A <l B saying
for instance that B is at least as possible as A_ In
this direction, a qualitative characterization of possi-

bility measures was first given in [Dubois 86), where
it was established a formal relation between possibil­
ity theory and qualitative possibility relations. Since
then several logics of qualitative possibility have been
proposed to allow specifying partial qualitative pos­
sibility relations and deriving consequences based on
this partial information. Farinas and Herzig [Farinas &
Herzig, 91] axiomatize the logic of qualitative possibil­
ity called QP L, introducing a conditional connective
2:, and they relate it to the Lewis' conditional logic
V N. They also propose a multi-modal logic based
on sphere semantics to fully support possibility the­
ory. Boutilier presents in [Boutilier, 92] a possible
worlds semantics for qualitative possibility relations
and defines two modal logics, co and co·, and he
makes use of two modalities to capture possibilistic
logic. One corresponds as usual to truth at acces­
sible worlds while the other to truth to inaccessible
worlds. Finally, in [Bendova & Hajek, 93] qualitative
possibilistic logic is related to a tense logic with finite
linearly preordered time called F LPOT, pushing fur­
ther some aspects of the previous works, specially the
incompleteness of Q P L and the ptecise relation of the
above modal systems with unary modalities to QPL.
It is also worth noticing that similar attempts of re­
lating other quantitative and qualitative uncertainty
measures have been proposed in the literature. See for
instance [Segerberg, 71] or [Bacchus, 90] for the case
of probability measures or [Harmanec & Hajek, 94],
[Resconi, Klir & St. Clair, 92] for belief and plausibil­
ity measures. See also [Wong et a!., 91].
On the other hand, vagueness (fuzziness) concerns de­
grees of truth, usually numerical, and therefore one
is led to many-valued logics as underlying formalism.
In this sense, fuzzy logic deals with fuzzy propositions
that may have intermediate degrees of truth and it is
usually understood as truth-functional, i.e. the truth
degree of a compound formula is a function of the truth
degrees of its subformulas using suitable connectives.
Because of this key feature, fuzzy logic departs from
any uncertainty logic.
So far, as argued elsewhere ([Godo & Mantaras, 93],
[Hajek, 93], [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]), we have
seen that qualitative uncertainty (possibility) leads to

On Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility in a Fuzzy Setting

modal logics, while fuzziness leads to many-valued log­
ics. Therefore, presence of both fuzziness and uncer­
tainty leads to calculi that are both many-valued and
modal. Modal many-valued logics have been already
investigated by some authors, see for instance [Oster­
mann, 88} or [Fitting, 92}. Our goal is to study logical
systems of qualitative possibility dealing with fuzzy
propositions. It is clear then that the first question
one is faced with is how to compare formulas of fuzzy
logic with respect to their possibility or, more general,
with respect to the possibility measures of worlds on
which they have a given truth-value. This question
has not an unique answer. For instance, in a recent
and very related works [Hajek & Harmancova, 93},
[Hajek, Harmancova & Verbrugge, oo] the possibility
of a fuzzy formula is described by a fuzzy truth-value,
i.e. a function that provides, for each truth-value c:r,
the possibility of the fuzzy formula being a-true. The
corresponding modal calculus QF L of comparison of
possibilities is there shown to have a faithful interpre­
tation in a certain many-valued tense logic (with lin­
early preordered time), and thus naturally extending
the results in [Bendova & Hajek, 93].
In the present paper we investigate qualitative fuzzy
logics based on an alternative definition of possibility
of a fuzzy formula, following the well known Zadeh's
extension of classical possibility measures to fuzzy
propositions (cf. [Zadeh, 78] [Dubois & Prade, 85]).
With this definition, the possibility of a formula of
fuzzy logic is again only one value. Furthermore, in
our setting the possibility of a formula is just a truth
value. To simplify matters, we make the following de­
sign choices: we investigate finitely valued Lukasiewicz
fuzzy logics where the set Values of truth values co­
incides with the set of allowed possibility degrees. We
show that this notion is useful to express statements
about qualitative possibility comparisons. The corre­
sponding comparative logic QF £21 is shown to sat­
isfy reasonable axioms and to be closely related to
the many-valued analogue MV55 of the modal logic
55. In Artificial Intelligence, 55 is often understood
as the logic of knowledge whereas its weakening I< D45
is understood as the logic of belief (cf [Voorbraak, 93},
[Halpern & Moses, 92}). We relate our calculi also
to K D45 and its many-valued counterpart MVKD45.
Completeness theorems for MV55 and MVf{ D45 are
obtained. This is not a too surprising result; [Fit­
ting, 92] has much about completeness of many valued
modal logics and [Ostermann, 88] too. But we present
Hilbert-style systems and get their completeness. Cf.
also [Nakamura, 91a, 91b] for a different approach.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the
underlying many-valued propositional calculus is de­
scribed. In Section 3, possible world semantics for the
qualitative fuzzy logic Q F L2 is introduced, while in
Section 4 we prove its faithful interpretation on the
many-valued modal MV55, also described in this sec1

tion. Finally, in Section 5 the logic MVf{ D45 is pre­
sented and proved that Q F L2 can be also faithfully
interpreted there. We end with some concluding re­
marks.

MANY-VALUED
PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS
USED

Fix a natural number n ;?: 2; we base our investigations
over the n-valued propositional Lukasiewicz's logic Ln,
as described e.g. in [Gottwald, 88]. This choice does
not imply that we claim Lukasiewicz's logic be the only
formal logical system for fuzzy logic. Our set of truth
values is Values= {0, 1/(n-1), . . . , 1}. Principal con­
nectives are implication and negation, denoted respec­
tively by-+ and ...,, with Lukasiewicz semantics: ...,A is
interpreted by 1- x and A-+ B by min(l- x + y, 1)
where x , y E Values are the interpretations of A
and B respectively; occasionally we write I(x, y) for
min(l- x + y, 1). Other connectives are defined from
-+and-,, in particular, there are two conjunctions and
two disjunctions. We have the connectives 1\ and V,
interpreted by min(x, y) and max(x, y) respectively,
and & interpreted by max(O, x + y- 1), and its dual
Y... interpreted by min(l, x + y). The equivalence con­
nective +-+ is interpreted by min(I(x, y), l(y, x)). A
complete axiomatization of Ln extends the celebrated
axiomatization of L00 [Rose and Rosser, 58] by some
few additional axioms, namely:
•
•
•
•

A-+ (B-+ A),
(A_, B)-+ ((B-+ C)-+ (A-+ C)),

07=1 A for A& . . ."l . . . &A. Note the !-tautologies
(A-. (B ___.C)),..... ((A&B ) _,C) and (...,(A_, B)) ......
(A&-,B). Further note the !-tautology (A -> B) ......
( ...,B -+ ..,A). We extend Ln by unary connectives (co­
efficients) (i) for each i E Values; the value of (i)A is
1 iff the value of A is i, otherwise the value of (i)A is
0. In fact the connectives (i) are definable in Ln, see
[Ostermann, 88] or [Gottwald, 88]. Finally notice that
Dienes and Godel's implications are also definable in
Ln as -.A V B and (1)(A-> B) V B respectively.
In the sequel, the constant True will stand forA -> A,
False for -,True, and B0-formulas will be formulas
generated from formulas of the form ( i)A using con­
nectives and coefficients. Clearly, each such a formula

Hajek, Hannancova, Esteva, Garcia, and Godo

is Boolean in the semantic sense: it takes only values
1 and 0. (Later we introduce another class of formulas
that are Boolean). We list next some axioms on formu­
las containing coefficients (cf. [Hajek & Harmancova,
93]); in fact they are provable (by definability of coef­
ficients and completeness of axioms for Ln)·

The corresponding dual notion of necessity can be

The idea behind the above definition is to use it in next
sections to interpret in our comparative logic QF L2
sentences of type B is at least as possible as A, being
A and B many-valued, as II(A) ::; II(B). This inter­
pretation extends to the fuzzy (many-valued) case , in
a different way than QF L, the comparison of possibili­
ties that is present in the qualitative possibilistic logics
QPL, CO and F LPOT mentioned in the introduction
section. However, it is worth noticing that other ways
of extending the notion of possibility for fuzzy propo­
sitions have been also advocated; see [Dubois & Prade,
92] for a discussion of such extensions. Next lemmas
show a characterization of possibility measures II given
by possibilistic Kripke models.
Lemma 3.2 {cf. {Dubois fj Prade, 1988]} For each
possibilistic Kripke model K, II satisfies the following:

II(False)= 0

(II2) II(A VB)= max(II(A), II( B ))

(II3) if Ln f-A+-+ B then II(A) = II(B)

The only deduction rule is modus ponens. This ends
our description of the underlying propositional calcu­
lus.

Proof" We only prove the last equality.

KRIPKE MODELS,
POSSIBILITIES

Our possibilistic Kripke models over a set Atom of
propositional atoms have the form
[{= (W, lh rr)

where W is a non-empty set of possible worlds, If­
maps Atom x W into Values, 1r maps W into Values
and maxw EW rr ( w) = 1. Recall that we consider possi­
bilities taking values only in Values. We extend If- in
the obvious way to a mapping (denoted again by If-)
of Forma x W into Values where Form0 is the set
of all formulas of our propositional logic satisfying the
usual inductive conditions. We write II A llw= i for
If-(A, w) = i. Concerning satisfiability, we shall write
wlf-A iff I I A llw= 1. (Note II A llw= i i ff wlf-(i)A.)
The corresponding notions of validity and semantical
entailment are the usual ones.
After Zadeh (cf. [Zadeh 1978], [Dubois & Prade, 86)),
we introduce the following notion of the possibility
degree of a {fuzzy) formula A E Form0 in a possibilis­
tic Kripke model, that extends to many-valued propo­
sitions the notion of classical possibility measure for
two-valued propositions which plays a central role in
possibilistic logic.

atoms to be finite. If a mapping II : Forma --+ [0, 1]
satisfies the axioms (II 1- II4) of the preceding lemma
then there is a finite Kripke model f{ such that II is
the possibility given by f{.
Lemma 3.3 Assume the set

Proof" Note that (II4) guarantees that it is enough to
produce a Kripke model f{ whose possibility coincides
with II for B0-formulas. Now it is easily seen that each
B0-formula .is equivalent to a Boolean combination of
formulas of the form (i)p where p is a propositional
atom.
Therefore, we may produce a model f{ in full
'
analogy to the two-valued case: each B0-formula B
is Ln-equivalent to a disjunction of maximal elemen­
tary conjunctions of the form (\7':_1 (j; )p;, where m is
the cardinality of the set Atom, thus for each such B
there is a maximal elementary conjunction C such that
II(B) = II(C). Thus we construct our model from the
•
elementary conjunctions in the usual way.

Notice that, given a possibilistic Kripke model K =
{W, If-, rr) over a set Atom of atoms, if p is a propo­
sitional variable not in Atom, I< clearly determines
uniquely a model I<' = {W, If-') over Atom' = Atom U
{p} such that If-' coincides with If- on Atom and
lf-'(p, w) = rr(w) for each w E W. (K' has no ex­
plicit structure on W .) Models of the form {W, IH

below). If ]{' = (W, It-') is an MVS5-model over

definable from 0. So it makes sense, for our purposes
of investigating the logic of comparison of possibilities,
to axiomatize the D modality. This is our next task.
First, observe that if a formula A is Boolean (takes
only values 0,1) then OA is also Boolean; but of course
OpA need not be Boolean. Define the class of B­
formulas to be the class of formulas resulting from
formulas of the form (i)A, where A is an arbitrary
formula, possibly containing modalities, using connec­
tives. Thus each B-formula is Boolean.
Definition 4.2

MANY-VALUED LOGIC MVS5

We enrich our language by three modalities, 0, Op and
<lp (for Atom' = AtomU{p}) and define their seman­
tics as follows.
II OA l]w= max{ll A llw'l w' E W};
II OpA llw = max{ll pi\ A llw'l w' E W};
A <lp B is OrA- OpB
the corresponding duals DA, DpA and A -<p B being
defined as· -,0-,A, ....,op...,A and ...,{...,A <lp -.B) respec­
tively.

Note that formulas OA, OpA and A <lp B take a con­
stant value independently of a given wE W. Thus we
shall write from now on II OA I I, II OpA II etc. Next
lemma summarizes properties and relations among the
above modalities; note that we work with models K'
in which max(ll p llwl w) = 1, i.e. II Op II= 1.
Lemma 4.1 The

following properties hold for any

formulas A and B:
(a) II DA II= min{II A llw I wE W}

(b) II OpA II= II(A),
II DpA II = N(A)

{c) OpA is equivalent to O(p A A),
DpA is equivalent to D( ...,p VA)
{d) A -<p B is equivalent to DpA- DPB
(e) II A <l p B I I = 1 iff II (A) ::; II (B),
II A -<p B II= 1 iff N(A) ::; N(B)

propositional axioms as in Section 2 but the ax­

are postulated for all B-formulas, not only
formulas;

where ll (and N) is defined by extension of definition
3.1 to any formula in the obvious way.
Thus it is clear that the modality Op captures the pos­
sibility n whereas the binary modality <lp captures the
comparison of possibilities. Furthermore, the lemma
shows that OP and <l P are interdefinable and both are

Theorem 4.3

The proof is standard and sketched at the end of this
section.
Next step is to formally introduce our qualitative
modal logic for comparison of possibilities of fuzzy
propositions, and to faithfully embed it in MVS5
Definition 4.4 The qualitative modal fuzzy logic
QFL2 over a set Atom of atoms has formulas built

up from atoms (propositional variables) using logical
connectives and a binary modality <l; models are pos­
sibilistic models (W, lh rr) and the semantics is

(f) OpA is equivalent to True <l P A,

DpA is equivalent to True -<p A

The modal logic MVSS has the fol­

lowing axioms:

II A<] B II=
= I(maxw(ll A l[w A7r(w)), maxw(ll B llw J\1r (w))).

It is worth noticing that Jl A <l B II= 1
ll(B).
Definition 4.5

iff

II(A) ::=::;

Given a variable p not in Atom, the
translation of QFL2 formulas to MVSS formulas is de­
fined recursively as follows:

nectives,
(A <l B) * is A* <lp B*.

Finally define A

• .

The above mapping ** is a faithful in­
terpretation of QFL2 in MVS5, i.e. a formula A of
Q F L2 is a )-tautology iff A"* is a MVS5-tautology.
Proof: Let K = {W, lh 1r) be a rriodel of Q F L2 and let

wlf-(i)A. Then K' = (W, I�') constructed above is a
model of MVS5 and K'lf-'(l)Op, wlf-'(i)A* and hence
wlf-'A**. Thus if A** is a 1-tautology of MVSS, then
A is a 1-tautology of QFL2.

Conversely, let K1 = {W, I�' ) be a MVS5-model (of
the language extended by p). If Kdf-'( < l)Op then
clearly K1lf-'(l)A**; if I<d�'(l)Op then I<1 =I<' for
the obvious I<. If wlf-'(i)A** then wl�'(i)A* and
wlf-(i)A. Thus if A is a 1-tautology of QF L2 then
•
A** is a 1-tautology of MVS5.
In the rest of this section we sketch a proof of the
completeness of MVS5.
Recall B-formulas; a theory is a set of B-formulas in­
cluding all formulas (1)C where Cis MVS5-provable.
T f- C (T proves C) if there is a proof of C from T
using only modus ponens (no necessitation). T is com­
plete if for each B-formula C, T f- C or T f- ...,c. As
usual, it suffices to show the following Lemma.
Lemma 4. 7

(Mazn Lemma) If To is a complete the­
ory and T0 f- (i)A then there is a model /{ = {W, I�)
and a wE W such that wiHi)A.

To build such a model we need first some previous
results.

Let T and To be complete theories.
We say that T and To are equivalent, written T Ri T0,
provided that for each i and A, T f- (i) DA iff T0 f­
(i)DA, or equivalently, T f- (i)OA iff To f- (i)OA.

THE LOGIC

Q F L2

(b) (3TRiT0)(Tf-(i)C)

The QF L2 comparative modality <l introduced in the
previous section relies fundamentally on the MVS5
modality <>p. Therefore it seems interesting to inves­
tigate a possible axiomatization of the modality Op
itself, without needing to refer it to any other modal­
ity. To this end, in this section we relate our QF L2 to
a many-valued version of the belief logic K D45 (see
e.g. [Voorbraak]). Our MV/{ D45 will be a subtheory
of MVS5 (like f{ D45 is a subtheory of 55); if there
are only two values (Values= {0, 1}) then MVK D45
becomes K D45 like MV 55 becomes 55. Moreover,
a faithful embedding of QF L2 into MV/{ D45 is very
easy to define.
Models of MV /{ D45 are again possibilistic Kripke
structures /{ :::: (W, 1�, 11'), where 71' is a normalized
possibility distribution on W with values in Values
that can be understood as a many-valued accessibility
relation R defined as R(w, w') = 1r(w' ). Such many­
valued accessibility relations already occur in [Fitting,
92].

For each i and C such that To 1(i)OC let Tc be a theory T as in (b) in the above

more natural choice would be II DA II= minw ( 1r ( w ) )

axioms of modal logic, namely D(A -+ B) -+ (DA ->

(4) Furthermore, one should give up the assumption
that Values is finite and study the full Lukasiewicz's
logic with real values.

Finally, QF L2 is related to MVKD45 in the way next
theorem shows.

parative modality in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93] and in
this present paper it is also a matter of future research.

CONCLUDING REMA RKS AND
FUTURE WORK

In this paper we have investigated, from a logical point
of view, a modality for comparison of possibilities of
fuzzy propositions. In this sense, this paper tackles
the same problem as in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]
but with another approach. Taking as referen ce the
Zadeh's extension of the concept of possibility mea­
sures to fuzzy propositions, the corresponding com­
parative logic QF L2 has been related to two many­
valued modal systems namely MVS5 and MVKD45,
for which complete axiom systems, Hilbert style, h ave
been given. However a number of open questions re­
main for future investigation. Some of them are listed
below.
(1) It would be desirable to replace axioms (1), (2) of
definition 5.6 by some other more elegant axioms (in
particular not dealing explicitly with m.e.c.'s). One
tautology more similar to the axioms of MVS5 is
(;?: i)DC ,..... ( ;?: i )D ( ;?: i)C.

(2) Our choice of semantics of DA in MVKD45 might
seem unnatural:
II DA II= minw((l- 1r(w)) V II A llw)- A seemingly
