We investigate an approach to reasoning about
causes through argumentation. We consider a causal
model for a physical system, and look for arguments
about facts. Some arguments are meant to provide
explanations of facts whereas some challenge these
explanations and so on. At the root of argumentation
here, are causal links ({A1 , · · · , An } causes B) and
ontological links (o1 is_a o2 ). We present a system
that provides a candidate explanation ({A1 , · · · , An }
explains {B1 , · · · , Bm }) by resorting to an underlying
causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological
links. Argumentation is then at work from these various
explaining links. A case study is developed : a severe
storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in 2010,
with an unaccountably high number of casualties.

Introduction and Motivation

Looking for explanations is a frequent operation, in various domains, from judiciary to mechanical fields. We

consider the case where we have some precise (not necessarily exhaustive) description of some mechanism, or situation, and we are looking for explanations of some facts.
The description contains logical formulas, plus some causal and ontological formulas (or links). Indeed, it is known
that, while there are similarity between causation and implication, causation cannot be rendered by a simple logical
implication. Also, confusing causation and co-occurrence
could lead to undesirable relationships. This is why we
use here a causal formalism where some causal links and
ontological links are added to classical logical formulas.
Then the causal formalism will produce various explanation links [1]. However, if the situation described is complex enough, this will result in a great number of possible
explanations, and some argumentation is involved in order
to get some reasons to choose between all these candidate
explanations.
In this text, we will consider as an example a severe
storm, called Xynthia, which made 26 deaths in a single
group of houses in La Faute sur Mer, a village in Vendée during a night in February 2010. This was a severe
storm, with strong winds, low pressure, but it had been
forecast. Since the casualties were excessive with respect
to the strength of the meteorological phenomenon, various
investigations have been ordered. This showed that various
factors combined their effects. The weather had its role, however, other factors had been involved : recent houses and a
fire station had been constructed in an area known as being
susceptible of getting submerged. Also, the state authorities did not realize that asking people to stay at home was
inappropriate in case of flooding given the traditionally low
Vendée houses.
In this paper, we define in section 2 an enriched causal

model, built from a causal model and an ontological model.
We then show in section 4 how explanations can be derived
from this enriched causal model. We explain in section 5
the use of argumentation in order to deal with the great
number of possible explanations obtained and conclude in
section 6. The Xynthia example, introduced in section 3, is
used as illustration throughout the article.

simply means that β can be deduced from α due to specialiis-a
zation/generalization links, the −→ links in the ontological
model, that relate the classes of objects mentioned in α and
ded ont
β. Note that the relation −→ is transitive and reflexive.
Here is an easy illustration. A sedan is a kind of car,
is-a
which is represented by sedan −→ car in the ontological
ded ont
model. Then, Iown(sedan) −→ Iown(car) is an ontological deduction link in the enriched model.
ded ont
Technically, the −→ links among literals are generated
by means of a single principle as follows. The predicates
used in the causal model are annotated so that each of their
parameters is sorted either as universal or as existential.
A universal parameter of a predicate “inherits” by specialization, meaning that if the predicate is true on this parameter then the predicate is also true for specializations
of this parameter. The existential parameters of a predicate
“inherits” by generalization, meaning that if a the predicate
is true on this parameter, then the predicate is also true for
generalizations of this parameter (cf above example of our
owner of a sedan).
As another example, consider the unary predicate
Flooded, where Flooded(o) means that class o (an
area or a group of buildings) is submerged. Its unique
parameter is taken to be “universal” so that if the literal
Flooded(o) is true, then the literal Flooded(s) is also
true whenever s is a specialization of o. The causal model
ded ont
is enriched by adding Flooded(o) −→ Flooded(s) for
is-a
each class s satisfying s −→ o.
Let us now consider the unary predicate Occurs so
that Occurs(Hurri) intuitively means : some hurricane
occurs. Exactly as above “I own” predicate, this predicate is existential on its unique parameter. By means of
is-a
is-a
the −→ link Hurri −→ SWind, we obtain the following
ded ont
ded ont
−→ link : Occurs(Hurri) −→ Occurs(SWind).
ded ont
Let us provide the formal definition of −→ links in the
case of unary predicates. Then, the general case is a natural,
but intricate and thus ommitted here, generalization of the
unary case.

Enriched causal model = Causal model + ontological model

The model that is used to build tentative explanations
and support argumentation, called the enriched causal model, is built from a causal model relating literals in causal links, and from an ontological model where classes
of objects are related through specialization/generalization
links.
2.1

The causal model

By a causal model [8], we mean a representation of a
body of causal relationships to be used to generate arguments that display explanations for a given set of facts.
The basic case is that of a causal link “α causes β” where
α and β are literals. In this basic case, α stands for the
singleton {α} as the general case of a causal link is the
form
{α1 , α2 , · · · , αn } causes β
where {α1 , α2 , · · · αn } is a set (interpreted conjunctively)
of literals.
Part of the causal model for our Xynthia example is given in Fig. 2 (each plain black arrow represents a causal
link).
2.2

The ontological model

The literals P (o1 , o2 , · · · , ok ) occurring in the causal
model use some predicates P applied to classes of objects oi . The ontological model consists of specialization/generalization links between classes of objects
is-a

o1 −→ o2 ,
is-a

where −→ denotes the usual specialization link between
is-a
classes. E.g., we have Hurri −→ SWind, House1FPA
is-a
is-a
−→ HouseFPA and HouseFPA −→ BFPA : a “hurricane” (Hurri) is a specialization of a “strong wing”
(SWind), and the class of “low houses with one level
only in the flood-prone area” (House1FPA) is a specialization of the class of “houses in the flood-prone area”
(HouseFPA), which itself is a specialization of the class
of “buildings in this area” (BFPA). A part of the ontological model for our Xynthia example is given in Fig. 1
(each white-headed arrow labelled with is-a represents an
is-a
−→ link).

The enriched causal model

The causal model is extended by resorting to the ontological model, and the result is called the enriched causal
model. The enrichment lies in the so-called ontological deded ont
duction links (denoted −→ ) between literals. Such a link
ded ont

α −→ β

Definition 1 Let us suppose that P rop1∃ and P rop2∀ are
two unary predicates, of the “existential kind” for the first
one, and of the “universal kind” for the second one. If in the
is-a
ontology is the link class1 −→ class2 , then the following
two links are added to the enriched model :
ded ont
P rop1∃ (class1 ) −→ P rop1∃ (class2 ) and
ded ont
P rop2∀ (class2 ) −→ P rop2∀ (class1 ).

ded ont

In our formalism, causal and ontological links −→ entail
classical implication :
Vn
{α1 , · · · αn } causes α entails ( i=1 αi ) → α.
(1)
ded ont
α −→ β entails α → β.
Ordinary logical formulas are also allowed (for example
for describing exclusions), which are added to the formulas
coming from (1).
When resorting to explanations (see section 4 below),
ded ont
these −→ links are extended to sets of literals (links denoont
ted by →ded
) as follows :
set
Definition 2 Let Φ and Ψ be two sets of literals, we define
ont
Φ →ded
Ψ, if for each ψ ∈ Ψ, there exists ϕ ∈ Φ such
set
ded ont
ded ont
that ϕ −→ ψ (remind that ψ −→ ψ).

The following predicates are introduced : (Flooded)
and (Victims_I) applied to a group of building respectively meaning that “flooding” occurs over this group, and
that there were “victims” in this group (I ∈ {1, 2, 3} is
a degree of gravity, e.g. Victims_1, Victims_2 and
Victims_3 respectively mean, in % of the population
of the group : “a small number”, “a significant number”
and “a large number” of victims). OK means that its
unique parameter is in a normal state. Occurs means
that some fact has occurred (a strong wind, a disaster,
. . .), Expected means that some fact is expected to occur.
All these predicates are “universal” on their unique parameter, except for the predicates Occurs and Expected
which are “existential”.

is-a

Notice that if a sedan is a kind of car (sedan −→ car),
and Own a predicate existential on its unique argument,
ont
then we get
{Iown(sedan), IamHappy} →ded
set
{Iown(car), IamHappy},
and
ont
{Iown(car)}.
{Iown(sedan), IamHappy} →ded
set

Note that negation of a literal is expressed by Neg
as in Neg OK(Anemo) meaning that the anemometer is not in its normal behaviour state (the formula
¬(OK(Anemo) ∧ (NEG OK(anemo)) is thus added).

The classes and the ontological model are given in Fiis-a
gure 1 with the −→ links represented as white-headed arrows labelled with (is-a).

The Xynthia example

From various enquiries, including one from the French
parliament 1 and one from the Cours des Comptes 2 and
many articles on the subject, we have many information
about the phenomenon and its dramatic consequences. We
have extracted a small part from all the information as an
illustration of our approach.
The classes we consider in the ontological model and/or
in the causal model are the following ones : Hurri,
SWind, BFPA, House1FPA, HouseFPA, and BFPA
have already been introduced in §2.2, together with a
is-a
few −→ links. Among the buildings in the flood-prone
area, there is also a fire station FireSt (remind that
we have also a group of houses HouseFPA, including a
group of typical Vendée low houses with one level only
House1FPA). We consider also three kinds of natural
disasters (NatDis) : Hurri, together with “tsunami”
(Tsun) and “flooding” (Flooding). As far as meteorological phenomena are concerned, we restrict ourselves
to “Very low pressure” (VLPress), together with already
seen Hurri and SWind, and finally we add ‘high spring
tide” (HSTide) to our list of classes.
Two kinds of alerts (Alert) may be given by the
authorities, “Alert-Evacuate” (AlertEvac) and “AlertStayAtHome” (AlertStay). We consider also an anemoter (Anemo) able to measure the wind strength and a fact
asserting that “people stay at home” (PeopleStay).

F IGURE 1 – Ontological model for Xynthia
Part of the causal model is given in Figure 2 (remember,
black-headed arrows represent causal links). It represents
causal relations between [sets of] literals. It expresses that
an alert occurs when a natural disaster is expected, or when
a natural disaster occurs. Also, people stay at home if
alerted to stay at home, and having one level home flooded
results in many victims, and even more victims if the fire
station itself is flooded,...

From the ontological model and the causal model, the
ded ont
enriched causal model can be build, adding −→ links between literals when possible.
For instance, for our “existential” predicates, from
is-a
Hurri −→ SWind, the links
ded ont
Occurs(Hurri) −→ Occurs(SWind), and
ded ont
Expected(Hurri) −→ Expected(SWind) are ad1. http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/rap-info/ ded.

We require also that the origin of the explanation is
possible, thus the full set of justifications is here the set
Φ ∪ {δ}, while in case of (2), this full set is Φ, even if
no set is given explicitly. Indeed, it is always understood
that the starting point of the explanation link must be
possible,Vthus we sometimes omit it. Remind that from (1)
we get ( ϕ∈Φ ϕ) → β and δ → β, thus adding β to the
justification set is useless.

Explanations
Explaining a literal from a [set of] literal[s]

Causal and ontological links allow us to infer explanation links. We want to exhibit candidate reasons that can
explain a fact by means of at least one causal link. We disregard explanations that involve only links of the implicational kind. Here is how causal and ontological links are
used in our formalism :
Let Φ denote a set of literals and β be a literal.
The basic case is that Φ causes β
yields that
β can be explained by Φ.

We want also that our explanation links can follow
ded ont
−→ links as follows, in the case where Φ = {ϕ} is a singleton (thus we note sometimes ϕ instead of {ϕ}) :


ϕ can explain δ provided Ψ is possible
ded ont
ded ont
ϕ0 −→ ϕ
δ −→ δ1
(4)
yields that ϕ0 can explain δ1 provided Ψ is possible
{ϕ0 } ∪ Ψ is the full justification set for this explanation of
δ1 by ϕ0 . Again we get ϕ0 → ϕ by (1), so we need not to
mention ϕ here.
Phi

The general initial case involves two literals β =
P rop(cl2 ) and δ = P rop(cl1 ) built on the same predicate P rop (eventual other parameters equal in these two
literals) :



Now, we also want that our explanation links are transitive, and this necessitates to be able to explain not only

literals, but sets of literals. Thus we introduce explanation
links among sets of literals, which extend our explanation
links from sets of literals towards literals (since it is an extension, we can keep the same name explanation link) :
4.2

Explaining a set of literals from a set of literals

Definition 3 Let n be some natural integer, and, for
i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n} Φ, Ψi be sets of literals and δi
be literals. If, for each i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}, we have
Φ can explain δi provided Ψi is possible,
then we define the following [set] explanation link
Φ can explain {δS
i /i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}}
n
provided i=1 Ψi is possible.
Again, such an explanation link
Sn applies only when its
(full) justification set, here Φ ∪ i=1 Ψi , is possible (not
contradicted by the data).
Notice that we do not want to explain Φ by Φ itself, and
ont
links :
we extend this restriction to →ded
set
We do not want to explain Φ by Φ0 is all we know is
ont
Φ. Indeed, this seems to be cheating about what
Φ0 →ded
set
an explanation is (we want some causal information to play
a role).
However, in the line of (5), we want that explanations

then we have
Φ0 can explain ∆1 provided Ψ is possible
Again, the full justification set of the resulting explaining
link is Φ0 ∪ Ψ.
Our last definition of [set] explanation links concerns
transitivity of explanations. This is a “weak” transitivity
since the justifications are gathered, however, we will call
this property “transitivity”. We need to be able to omit in
the resulting link the part of the intermediate set which is
already explained in the first explanation giving rise to a
transitive link :
Definition 5 If


Φ can explain ∆1 ∪ ∆2 provided Ψ1 is possible and
Γ ∪ ∆2 can explain Θ provided Ψ2 is possible,
then Φ ∪ Γ can explain ∆1 ∪ ∆2 ∪ Θ
provided Ψ1 ∪ Ψ2 is possible.
Again, the full justification set is Φ ∪ Γ ∪ Ψ1 ∪ Ψ2 .

4.3

About explanation links and arguments

As a small example, let us suppose that in the causal
model is the link
reason causes P rop∃ (class2 )
and that in the ontology are the links :
is-a
class1 −→ class2
is-a
class1 −→ class3
Resulting are the next two links in the enriched model :
ded ont
P rop∃ (class1 ) −→ P rop∃ (class2 )
ded ont
P rop∃ (class1 ) −→ P rop∃ (class3 )
By pattern matching over the diagrams in Fig. 4 and 5
[cf patterns (3) and (5], we get
reason can explain P rop∃ (class3 ) through P rop∃ (class1 )
(“justification”).
Importantly, it is assumed that the causal link is expressed
on the appropriate level : in other words, should there be
some doubts about the kind of objects (here class2 ) that
enjoy P rop∃ due to reason, the causal link would be about
another class.
The proviso accompanying the explanation takes place
at the level of justifications : the candidate explanation is
worth inasmuch as P rop∃ (class1 ) is not contradicted. In
particular it must be consistent with the reason causing
P rop∃ (class3 ) [remind (1)].
Here is an example from Xynthia data. Consider the causal link
Expected(V LP ress) causes Expected(SW ind)
together
with the following ontological
links
(
)
is-a
Hurri −→ SW ind

The links below can be obtained in the enriched model

We get an argument to the effect that from the set of


ded ont
Expected(Hurri) −→ Expected(N atDis)
we obtain :

Θ yields that

Expected(V LP ress) can explain
Expected(N atDis) provided Expected(Hurri) is
possible.
The intuition is that, from these data, it is reasonable
to explain Expected(N atDis), by Expected(V LP ress),

provided Expected(Hurri) is possible (not contradicted
by other data).
4.4

An example of compound explanations

Figure 6 displays an example from Xynthia (cf also
Fig. 3) of a few possible explanations, represented by
dotted lines, with their label such as 1 or 1a. The sets
of literals, from which the explaining links start, are
framed and numbered from (1) to (5). This shows transitivity of explanations at work : e.g. set 1 can explain
Victims_1(BFPA) (explanation link labelled 1+1a+1b)
uses explanation links 1, 1a and 1b.
Another example is
set 5 can explain Victims_3(House1FPA) (explanation link 1+1a+2+3) :
explanations 1, 1a, 2 and 3 are at work here, and link 2 uses
links 1 and 1a together with
ded ont
Flooded(BFPA) −→ Flooded(House1FPA)
while explanation 3 comes from links 1+1a together with
ded ont
Flooded(BFPA) −→ Flooded(FireSt).

a set of literals.
– Θ,

Argumentation

As just seen, the enriched causal graph allows us to infer
explanations for assertions and these explanations might be
used in an argumentative context [2, 3]. Let us first provide
some motivation from our example.
A possible set of explanations for the flooded buildings
is constituted by the bad weather conditions (“very low
pressure” and “strong wind”) together with “high spring
tide” (see Fig. 2). Given this explanation (argument), it is
possible to attack it by noticing : a strong wind is supposed
to trigger the red alarm of my anemometer and I did not

Counter-arguments

Generally speaking, an argument “Φ can explain γ in
view of Θ, provided ∆ is possible” is challenged by any
statement which questions
1. either Φ (e.g., an argument
exhibiting an explanation
V
for the negation of Φ)
2. or γ (e.g., an argument exhibiting an explanation for
the negation of γ)
3. or ∆ (e.g., an argument
exhibiting an explanation for
V
the negation of ∆)
4. or any item in Θ (e.g., an argument exhibiting an explanation for the negation of Θ for some θ occurring
in Θ)
5. or does so by refutation : using any of Φ, Θ, ∆ and γ
to explain some falsehood.
Such objections are counter-arguments (they have the form
of an argument : they explain something –but what they
explain contradicts something in the challenged argument).
Dispute. Let us consider the illustration at the start
of this section : The argument (that the buildings in the
flood-prone area are flooded can be explained, partly, by
a strong wind) is under attack on the grounds that my
anemometer did not turn red –indicating that no strong
wind occurred. The latter is a counter-argument of type
5 in above list. Indeed, the statement to be explained
by the counter-argument is the falsehood Red(anemo)
(e.g., Green(Anemo) has been observed), using SW ind,
i.e., an item in the explanation in the attacked argument.
Remember, the attacked argument is


¬OK(Anemo) can be explained by Occurs(Hurri)
where
– The explanation is Φ00 = {Occurs(Hurri)}.
– The statement being explained is
γ 00 = ¬OK(Anemo).
– The evidence is
Θ00 = {Occurs(Hurri) causes ¬OK(Anemo)}
The dispute can extend to a counter-counter-counterargument and so on as the process iterates.

Conclusion

The aim of this work is to study the link between causes
and explanations [5, 6], and to rely on explanations in an
argumentative context [2].
In a first part, we define explanations as resulting from
both causal and ontological links. An enriched causal model is built from a causal model and an ontology, from
which the explaining links are derived (cf e.g. Fig4 and
(2). Our work differs from other approaches in the literature in that it strictly separates causality, ontology and explanations, while considering that ontology is key in generating sensible explanations from causal statements. Note
however that some authors have already introduced ontology to be used for problem solving tasks as planning [7,
Chapter 2] and more recently for diagnosis and repair [9].
We then argue that these causal explanations are interesting
building blocks to be used in an argumentative context.
Although explanation and argumentation have long been
identified as distinct processes [10], it is also recognized
that the distinction is a matter of context, hence they both
play a role [4] when it comes to eliciting an answer to a
“why” question. This is exactly what is attempted in this
paper, as we are providing “possible” explanations, that
thus can be turned into arguments. The argument format
has some advantages inasmuch as its uniformity allows us
to express objection in an iterated way : “possible” explanations are challenged by counter-arguments that happen
to represent rival, or incompatible, “possible” explanations.
However, a lot remains to be done. Among others, comparing competing explanations according to minimality, preferences, and generally a host of criteria.
We have designed a system in answer set programming
that implements most of the explicative proposal introduced above. We plan to include it in an argumentative framework and think it will a good basis for a really practical
system, able to manage with a as rich and tricky example
as the full Xinthia example.

We propose an integration of possibility the­
ory into non-classical logics. We obtain many
formal results that generalize the case where
possibility and necessity functions are based
on classical logic. We show how useful such
an approach is by applying it to reasoning un­
der uncertain and inconsistent information.

Now, possibility theory brings in something more that
should be fruitfully exploited as complementary to
such aspects of reasoning. Hence, we study how to
integrate possibility theory with non-classical logics.
Our work comes from the following two facts:
•

even when the involved uncertainty has a possi­
bilistic nature, "classical" possibility theory may
not be well-suited to the addressed problem, due
to shortcomings, not of possibility theory itself
but of classical logic, on which possibility theory
is defined. For example, some problems require a
formalization with a local view of inconsistency:
this is impossible with classical possibility theory
(we need a paraconsistent approach, cfSection 3).

•

on the ot.her hand, non-standard logics su ch as
intuitionistic logic, paraconsistent logics,. . . are
not expressive enough to express uncertainty in
a gradual way.

Introduction

Possibility theory has been widely used in Artificial In­
telligence to represent uncertain knowledge in a more
qualitative way than, for example, probability theory:
indeed, it is equivalent to work with "quantitative"
possibility theory (which means using possibility and
necessity measures and possibility distributions, which
map formulas or worlds to [0, 1]) or with its qualitative
counterpart (where qualitative necessity and possibil­
ity relations are preorders on the logical language and
qualitative possibility distributions are just preorders
on the set of worlds). Besides, its connection to vari­
ous qualitative formalisms in logic and Artificial Intel­
ligence has been established, notably with epistemic
entrenchment relations in [DP 9la], conditional logics
in [Bou 92] [F HL 94], System Z in [BDP 92]. The use of
possibility theory in Artificial Intelligence covers non­
monotonic reasoning [DP 91b], belief revision, incon­
sistency handling, inheritance and default rules han­
dling, temporal reasoning, constraint satisfaction, . . .
In Knowledge Representation, many non-classical log­
ics have been used (note that in this paper we consider
only non-classical logics sharing the same language as
classical logic). Each of them was intended for some
particular focus, a specific aspect of reasoning: E.g.
paraconsistent logics have been used to deal with con­
tradictory knowledge bases. Or, intuitionistic logic has
been used to take into account some subtle distinctions
between statements involving double negation for ex­
ample. Or, Kleene's 3-valued logic {and other many­
valued logics) has been used to cope with statements
for which neither truth nor falsity make sense.

These arguments show that it is generally valuable to
integrate non-classical logics with a numerical theory
of uncertainty. Now, the reason why we focus in this
paper on possibility theory rather than another theory
of uncertainty, is its qualitative nature (as it amounts
to a "numerical account" of preordering relations over
formulas or worlds), which should make it a priori sim­
pler to generalize than more quantitative approaches
such as probability theory or belief functions.
The methodology we follow in this paper consists of
going from the general case to the particular case:
•

in Section 2, we investigate whether, and under
which conditions, important properties of possi­
bility theory remain valid when generalized. We
state the results in the most general case to make
the study "reusable", though the applications de­
veloped in Section 3 focus on paraconsistency.

•

in Section 3, we take a case study, that is, we
choose a paraconsistent logic (namely Ct) and dis­
cuss more practical applications to reasoning with
uncertain and inconsistent information.

Non-classical necessity and

possibility functions
2.1

Necessity /possibility functions

The natural presentation of necessity and possibility
functions (see [Zad 78] for instance) shows that pos­
sibility theory consists in meta-level definitions over
classical logic, which respect completely the structure
of classical logic.
This suggests that similar functions could be defined
on other logics than classical logic; so, replacing (.C,I-)
by (.C, f---L) where L is a given non-classical logic, we can
look for a definition of possibility/necessity functions
on the logic L. We deal with classical propositional1
languages, built from a list of propositional variables
- sometimes required to be finite -, and the connec­
tives -., 1\, V, �, <-> (where 1-L 9 <--> t/; is a shorthand
for 1-L 9 -+ t/; and 1-L t/; -+ ¥') . The only vary­
ing parameter is then the consequence relation f-L.
We now give a generic definition of non-classical ne­
cessity /possibility functions, of which the usual ne­
cessity /possibility functions correspond to the special
case where L is classical logic (Section 3 deals with the
special case where L is the paraconsistent logic Cr).

Definition: let .C be a classical propositional language
and 1-L a consequence relation, L being a given (maybe
non-classical) logic. A L-necessity function is a map­
ping N from .C to [0, 1] satisfying the following axioms2
(Taut) if

f---L 9

then

The dual functions of necessity functions are called
possibility functions. They can be defined by 3 axioms
about contradiction, equivalence and disjunction:

Some properties of non-classical
necessity /possibility functions

W hen L is classical logic, (L-)possibility functions can
be defined from (L-)necessity functions by means of
\lip E £, ll(lf') = 1- N(...,r.p) and (L-)necessity func­
tions can be defined from (L-)possibility functions by
V'(J E .C,N(¥') = 1-II(-.¥')· That is, "classical" neces­
sity and possibility functions enjoy the (double) dual­
ity property:
(Dl} II is a possibility function iff d n : £ -+ [0, 1]
defined by drr (r.p) 1 -II( -,'P) is a necessity func­
tion.
(D2) N is a necessity function iff dN : C -+ [0, 1] de­
fined by dN(9) = 1- N(-.9) is a possibility func­
tion.
=

(Eq) if 1-L 9 <--> t/; then N('P) = N(t/;)
(Conj) N(¥' 1\ t/;) = min(N(¥'), N(t/;))
When L is classical logic, we recover the classical ne­
cessity functions. Whatever the logic L is, the follow­
ing property always entails (Eq):
(Dom) if f---L 'P-+ t/; then N('P)::; N (t/;)

Some questions we may ask are: how can (D1) and
(D2) carry over to L-necessity and L-possibility func­
tions? When are (Dl) and (D2) equivalent?

Proposition 1: (Dom) is entailed by (Eq) and (Conj)

much difference since (Dam) ensures that contradictions
(resp. tautologies) have anyway the lowest (resp. highest)
necessity degree. Now, the reason why we require (Taut)
and not (Contr) concerns the characterization of necessity
functions in terms of possibility distributions.

Next, we investigate a few issues related to the con­
dition under which a function from C to [0, 1] can be
both a necessity and a possibility function.
a truth-functional valuation is a fun c­
tion f from C to [0, 1] such that there exist two non­

that 'V1p, t/J, f('P V t/J) = f(cp) ffi f(t/J) and /('P 1\ t/J) =
f(cp) 0 f(,P).
Definition: a logic L is said to admit trivialisation
of truth-functional valuations iff any truth-functional
valuation f satisfying (Dom), i.e. f-L 1p -+ t/J implies
f( 1p) � f( t/J) (we will also say that f is monotonic
w.r.t. 1-L) is a classical valuation, i.e. there are two

va luations holds in the case of classical propositional
logic ([Wes 87] (DP 88] - see also [DP 94] for a discus­
sion on the implications of this result). To study the

Semantics of L-necessity /possibility
functions

With the assumption that C is built from a finite
number of propositional variables, "classic al " neces­
sity /possibility functions can be semantically defined
by means of possibility distributions: a possibility dis­
tribution 7r is simply a fun cti on from the set n of all in­

terpretations for L to (0, 1]. The necessity function in­
duced by 1r is defined by N ( 'P) = inf{1-7r(w) /w f= ''P}
(with the convention inf 0 = 1 th at we take in all the
paper as well as sup 0 = 0). It can then be proved
that N is a necessity measure, and that any necessity
measure is induced by a possibility distribution.
We now turn to the general case of a logic L f or which
the class of L-m ode ls is wri tten nL .
a L-possibility distribution is a mapping
from �h to [0, 1 ] . It is said to be normalized iff
sup v E: i1L 7r(v) = 1.

is the logic E [AB 75]. On the other hand, intuitionistic

L-necessity orderings

It has been shown [Dub 86] that necessity and possi­
bility functions can be equivalently expressed in purely
qualitative terms, with preordering relations.
We
briefly give a generalization of this result, for the case
of necessities (the case for possibilities is similar).
Definition: A 1-necessity ordering is a relation on .C
satisfying the following properties:

rp 2:: 1/;

1/; 2:: � then rp 2:: � (transitivity)
1/; 2:: rp (dominance)
or rp 1\ tjJ � '1/J (conjunctiveness)

Vrp, 1/; E .C, we have 'P 2:: tP <:? !(rp) 2:: f('1/J ).
Definition

Proposition 16 (correspondence between 1-necessity
functions and 1-necessity orderings): the only map­
pings from .C to [0, 1] agreeing strictly with 1-necessity
orderings and also satisfying (Taut) are 1-necessity
functions.

Application to reasoning with
uncertain and inconsistent
information

3.1

Motivations

Possibility theory, as well as its qualitative counter­
parts such as epistemic entrenchment relations [GM
88], ranked knowledge bases [Pea 90] or rational clo­
sure [1eh 89] provide a relativized treatment of incon­
sistency, since the latter becomes a gradual notion.
I.e., a possibilistic knowledge base [D1P 94] consists
of a set of constraints KB = {(cp; ai),i = l..n}, where
(cp; a;) is a syntactic notation for the semantical con­
straint N(rp;) 2:: a;.

A possibilistic knowledge base is partially inconsis­
tent if it leads to enforce N(.l) > 0; stated oth­
erwise, the inconsistency degree of K B is defined
by Incons(KB) = maxs£;KB,S�l_ min(<p;a,)es a; =
min{N(.l), N satisfies KB}. Any formula below this
level, i.e. any rp; where a;:::; Incons(KB), is then in­
hibited (it is "drown" by the inconsistency [BCD1P
93]). This shows that the notion of inconsistency
in possibilistic logic and its qualitative counterpart is
gradual but global. The inconsistency level measures
to what extent the knowledge base is inconsistent, but
do not locate the inconsistency. The aforementioned
"drowning effect" is a consequence of this global treat­
ment of inconsistency. One way to cope with it is
to consider the knowledge base syntactically [Bre 89]
[Neb 91] [BCD1P 93], by selecting among maximal
sub-bases of KB using a criterion involving the a;'s.
However, these syntactical approaches do not have
(yet) any semantics in terms of uncertainty measures.
Now, using paraconsistent logics for handling incon­
sistent knowledge bases enables a local treatment of
inconsistency, by locating the inconsistency on some
formulas. Yet, these paraconsistent approaches do not
allow for any graduality in the inconsistency, which im­
plies some loss of information if the initial knowledge
was pertained with uncertainty.
While possibilistic logic allows for a gradual but global
treatment of inconsistency, where conflicts are solved
only by comparing the uncertainty level of the pieces of
information with the inconsistency level of the knowl­
edge base, the pure paraconsistent approach localizes
inconsistency, but conflicts cannot be ranked accord­
ing to uncertainty, importance, priority, normality as
done in rank-based systems. Thus paraconsistency is
not able to "solve" the conflicts. What we propose
here is to apply the results of Section 2 to a given
paraconsistent logic, namely C1 [daC 74], to handle
both uncertain and inconsistent knowledge, and with
a local treatment of inconsistency. We now give two
motivating examples, one about fusion of uncertain
information (multi-source reasoning) and one about
reasoning with default rules.
Example 1 (multi�source reasoning)
This example is borrowed from [Cho 94].
Two witnesses report their observations about a mur­
derer. Witness 1 (noted W1) is certain that the mur­
derer was a woman with blond hair, and believes (with
some uncertainty) that she was wearing a Chanel suit,
glasses, and was driving a BMW. Witness 2 (noted
W2) is certain that the murderer was a woman with
brown hair and that she was not wearing glasses, and
believes (with some uncertainty) that she was driving
a Fiat.

W1 female (sure), blond-hair (sure), drives-BMW
(unsure), wear-glasses (unsure), wear-Chanel­
sui t (unsure)
W2 female (sure), brown-hair (sure), drives-Fiat
(unsure), •wear-glasses (sure)

Possibility and Necessity Functions over Non-Classical Logics

What would we like to conclude about the following
statements?
•

Both witnesses agree that the murderer was fe­
male and are completely sure; so we want to con­
clude the murderer was female.

•

No contradiction either about wear-Chanel-suit
since witness 2 does not know anything.

•

Strong contradiction about the colour of the mur­
derer's hair; we wish to conclude neither blond
nor brown but we want to keep in mind that
these literals are "strongly subject to inconsis­
tency" (knowing the constraint •(blond-hair 1\
brown-hair)).

•

•

Contradiction about wear-glasses: the contradic­
tion is weaker than the one above since witness 1
is unsure; moreover, since witness 2's information
is prioritary to witness 1 's we would like to solve
the conflict (by concluding •wear-glasses).
Weak contradiction again, about the car; however,
since both witnesses are equally certain, we do not
want to conclude anything.

C1 [daC 7 4] is a paraconsistent logic, that is, a logic
in which a contradiction <p 1\ -,IP fails to entail other
arbitrary contradictions 1/J 1\ -,'ljJ cl retains all infer­

negation. For instance,

of classical logic that do appeal to negation are not

tion is fundamental: positive formulas and inferences
contribute to state what the facts are whereas negative
formulas and inferences are merely constraints (in the
sense of integrity constraints for databases). Accord­
ingly, cl allows us to elicit all and only the formulas
responsible for a given contradiction ([CL 92] (BL 941).
A valuation-based semantics for C1 (Alv 84] is given
in Section 3.2.3 as we now reproduce the original ax­
iomatic presentation of C1 that consists of the next
ten axioms
1. <p---+(1/J----><p)
2. (<p----> 1/J)----> [(10---+ (1/J--->

g1ves
.6. 1

=

.6.0

=

{penguin ......,. bird, penguin ---> •fly} ;
{bird ---. fly, bird ---+ wings}.

Adding the fact penguin to .6. enables us to infer •fly
but wings is not deduced (it is "drown" by the incon­
sistency appearing at rank 1). This particular case of
the drowning effect is known as the property of "in­
heritance blocking".
Considering .6. as a set of formulas for the logic C1, we
obtain
AU

{penguin} f-c, {fly, •fly, wings}.

Thus, we avoid the drowning effect but we do not take
into account priorities (induced by specificity) such as
penguin ......,. •fly over bird ......,. fly and we conclude
that fly is not well-behaved.
What we would like is to take advantage of the lo­
calisation of inconsistency, as done by paraconsistent
entailment, and the priority between formulas, which
would lead us to infer {fly, wings} but not •fly.
Note that prioritized syntax-based approaches based
on the selection of maximal consistent subsets of the
knowledge base guided by the priorities solve the
drowning effect but do not tell anything about where
the contradictions are localized; so, for instance, the
conclusion •wear-glasses is not relativised by the
fact that it is (weakly) subject to inconsistency.

C1 has the following basic features.

First, the con­

cannot be defined as • ( •<p 1\ •7./J). Second, the re­
placement of equivalent formulas does not hold. For
instance, (<p v 7./J) +--+ [(<p ---+ 1jJ) ......,. 7./J] is valid in C1 but

Reasoning with C1 Mnecessity functions
Generalizing the principle of minimum
specificity

The principle of minimum specificity [DP 86] or equiv­
alently,minimum compact ranking [Pea 90] and ratio­
nal closure [Leh 8 9] (all these being equivalent, up to
the language on which they are defined) induces, from
a possibilistic knowledge base, a particular necessity
function i.e. the smallest among all necessity functions
satisfying the knowledge base. Thanks to the prop­
erty (P3), we are able to generalize the principle of
minimum specificity to C1-necessity functions:

Definition: a C1-possibilistic knowledge base is a fi­
nite set KB = {(tp; a; ) , 1 � i � n} where if'; E .C and
a; E [0, l]. A C1-necessity function N is said to satisfy
KB iff Vi
l..n, N(lf'i) ;::: a;.

function defined by

Proposition 17 (principle of minimum specificity for
C1-necessities): For any Ct-necessity function N, N
satisfies KB iff N;::: NxsMore generally, the minimum specificity closure could
be extended to any logic L satisfying the property
(P3). Applying the principle of minimum specificity
enables us to draw conclusions that taking into account
the uncertainty and the inconsistency of the knowledge
base. We propose the following definition of a conse­
quence relation:

Definition: KB f--- '1/J iff Nxs ( .,P)

>

Nxs(-.'1/!0).

Proposition 18: KB f--- 'rP iff Nxs(t/;)

Definition: a C1-possibility distribution is a mapping
1r

We could have also defined C1-possibility functions,
C1-necessity and possibility orderings, that we do not
discuss for the sake of brevity. C1-necessity functions
are sufficient to deal with the next section, devoted to
the application to reasoning with uncertain and incon­
sistent knowledge.

is a Ct-necessity function (since Ct obeys the condi­
tion stated in Proposition 12 - the soundness of the
semantics coming from the soundness and complete­
ness of C1 established in [Alv 84]).

>

Nxs(-,'!j!).

Intuitively, we deduce '1/J from KB iff the certainty of
'1/J is higher than the inconsistency inherent to '1/J, or
equivalently, iff the certainty of 'lj; is higher than the
certainty of •¢. The binary version of f--- would be
defined by if' f'--KB '1/J iff Nxs(t.p -+ ¢) > Nxs(l;? -+
•if0), or equivalently iff Nxs(t.p--+ ¢) > Nxs(IP -+
-,'CjJ). Note that f-- is nonmonotonic; a more complete
study of the properties of f--- a Ia Kraus, Lehmann
and Magidor [KLM 90], is possible with respect to the
(monotonic) logic cl instead of classical logic.
Note that when N collapses to a classical necessity
measure, we haveVt/;Nx8(-.,P0) = N(..L) and f--- is the
classi cal possibilistic consequence relation [DP 91 b].

Possibility and Necessity Functions over Non-Classical Logics

(multi-source reasoning): let us return to
the example of Section 3.1. Taking some a E (0, 1 ) :

Example

•

•

W1 (witness 1):
N(female) = 1; N(brown) = 1; N(BMW) = a;
N(Chanel) = a ; N(glasses) = u:.
W2 (witness 2):
N(female) = 1; N(-.brown) = 1; N(-.BMW) =a;
N(-. glasses)= 1.

The fusion K B of these two knowledge bases gives the
following minimum specificity closure:
•

NKB(female) = 1; NKB(-.female) = 0;
NxB(-.female0) = 0;

•

NxB(brown) = 1; NKs(-.brown)= 1;
NxB(-.brown°) = 1;
NxB(BMW) u:; NxB(-.BMW) =a;
NxB(Chanel) =a; NKB(•Chanel) = 0;
NxB(•Chanel0) = 0;
NxB(glasses) = a; NKB(-.glasses)
1;
NxB(-.glasses0) = a.

•
•

•

=

=

Therefore, we have K B f--- female, K B f--- Chanel,
KB f--- -.glasses; however, KB lt- BMW, KB lt- •BMW,
K B lt- brown, K B lt- -,brown.

75

Therefore, we have
K B f--- •fly (which is intended);
K B f--- -,wings (which is intended);
f--- avoids the drowning effect, contrarily to
the classical minimum specificity closure,
System Z, and similar systems.
but also
K B f--- •live-in-Antarctica

which is not intended! (Due to NKB(fly) = /3, the
rule fly--+ •live-in-Antarctica applies).
Here is a revised definition, more suited to handling
default rules:
Definition: Let K B = FULl, where F is a set of
facts and Ll = {'Pi --+ 1/;i, i = l..n} a set of default
rules, where each rule is assigned a necessity degree
corresponding to its Z-ranking. We define

G0(Ll) =FuLl
and Vk 2': 0,

ck+l(Ll)
F u {.:p;--+ 1/;; E Gk(Ll) I NGk(f!.)('Pi) > NGk(f!.)(•.:pi)}
F u {'Pi--+ 1/;; E Gk{Ll) I Gk(Ll ) r- <:;';}.
k(Ll). Then Ll f---• 1/; iff
Lastly, let G00(Ll) = n >oG
kG00(Ll ) r- 1/;.
=

=

3.3.2

Handling default rules

Example:

Consider the fact penguin and the rules

� = {penguin---+ bird, penguin---+ •fly,
bird ---+ fly, bird ---+ wings,
fly--+ -.live-in-Antarctica}.
Applying the Z ranking procedure to Ll (written with
the possibilistic ranking convention) gives the ranking:
(for any a:, j3 such that 0 < j3 < a < 1)
{penguin--+ bird, penguin---+ --,fly,
fly---+ -.live-in-Antarctica};
�f3 = {bird ---+ fly, bird---+ wings}.

Lla

=

Then, taking the C1-minimum specificity closure of
K B = {penguin} U � leads to
•
•

•

NxB(penguin) = 1;
NxB(bird) u:;
NxB(•fly) =a;
NKB(fly--+ •live-in-Antarctica) =a;
NxB(fly) = /3;
NxB(•fly0) = /3;
NxB(wings) j3;
NxB(-.live-in-Antarctica) = /3;
NKB(-.bird)= 0;
NxB(-.bird0) = 0;
NxB(-.penguin) = 0;
NxB(--,penguin°) = 0;
NxB(-.wings) 0;
NxB(•wings0) = 0;
NxB(live-in-Antarctica)= 0;
NKB(--,live-in-Antarctica0) = 0.
=

=

•

=

Example:

We apply the usual ranking procedure:

� = {bird --+ fly, bird ---+ wings,
penguin ---+ bird, penguin ---+ -.fly,
fly---+ •live-in-Antarctica}.

G 1(Ll) = {penguin, bird---+ fly, bird--+ wings,
penguin ---+ bird, penguin --+ --,fly}.
Clearly, G00(Ll) = G1(6.). Therefore, Ll f---• •fly.
Also, Ll r-• bird and 6. f---1 wings. Contrastedly,
Ll �· •live-in-Antarctica.

Conclusion

We have given some basic results describing what re­
mains and what changes when switching from classi­
cal possibility theory to possibility theory over a non­
classical logic. We have then focused on a case study,
namely the paraconsistent logic C1, and showed how to
use it to reason with inconsistent and uncertain infor­
mation. W hat has been left aside in this paper is the
other possible applications of possibility theory over
non-classical logics: first, one could think of applying
the general results of Section 2 to other non-classical
logics: for instance, introducing possibility and ne­
cessity valuations into intuitionistic logic could model
gradual strengths of proofs; or, introducing them to
Kleene's logic (or more generally to a multi-valued
logic) would enable us to handle both uncertainty and
partial truth.

76

Besnard and Lang

Another topic for further research would be a parallel
study for other numerical theories of uncertainty. For
instance, paraconsistent probabilities would lead to a
more quantitative framework for reasoning with un­
certain and conflictual information; in this framework,
noticing that Prob( <p) + Prob( -.�.p) = Pro b( <p v -,<p) +
Prob( <pi\ -.�.p) = 1 + Prob( -.�.p0),relaxing the constraint
Prob( -.�.p0) = 0 would make P r ob( <p) + Prob( -.�.p) > 1
possible for some formulas; then one could think of
searching for the "least inconsistent" probability dis­
tribution satisfying a set of constraints, which could be
useful for instance when rectifying a set of inconsistent
probabilistic data.
