Learning Markov blanket (MB) structures has proven
useful in performing feature selection, learning
Bayesian networks (BNs), and discovering causal
relationships. We present a formula for efficiently
determining the number of MB structures given a
target variable and a set of other variables. As
expected, the number of MB structures grows
exponentially. However, we show quantitatively that
there are many fewer MB structures that contain the
target variable than there are BN structures that
contain it. In particular, the ratio of BN structures to
MB structures appears to increase exponentially in
the number of variables.

1. INTRODUCTION
An important task in machine learning and data mining is
to characterize how the target variable is influenced by
other variables in the domain. For example, the goal of a
classification or regression algorithm is to learn how the
target variable can be best predicted from the other
variables. One approach to characterizing the influence on
a target variable is to identify a subset of the variables that
shields that variable from the influence of other variables
in the domain. Such a subset of variables is called a
Markov blanket (MB) of the target variable. As
introduced by Pearl (Pearl 1988), the term MB refers to
any subset of variables that shield the target variable from
the influence of other variables in the domain. The
minimal Markov blanket or the Markov boundary is a
minimal subset of variables that shield the target variable
from the influence of other variables in the domain (Pearl
1988). Many authors refer to the minimal Markov blanket
as the Markov blanket, and we follow this convention.
The notion of MBs and the identification of MBs have
several uses in machine learning and data mining. The
identification of the MB of a variable is useful in the
feature (variable) subset selection problem (Koller and
Sahami 1996; Ioannis, Constantin et al. 2003). Feature
selection is useful in removing irrelevant and redundant
variables and in improving the accuracy of classifiers
(Dash and Liu 1997). MB identification can be used for

guiding the learning of the graphical structure of a
Bayesian network (BN) (Margaritis and Thrun 1999).
Identifying MBs is also useful in the discovery of causal
structures where the goal is to discover direct causes,
direct effects, and common causes of a variable of interest
(Mani and Cooper 2004).
Several methods of learning BNs from data have been
described in the literature (Cooper and Herskovits 1992;
Heckerman, Geiger et al. 1995). While the MB of a target
variable can be extracted from the BN learned by such
methods, methods that learn only the MB of a target
variable may be more efficient. The general motivation
for searching over the space of MBs is that it is smaller
than the space of BNs. Given a set of domain variables,
we quantify the size of the MB search space and compare
it to the size of the BN search space. We derive a formula
for efficiently determining the number of MB structures
of a target variable given other variables, and we also
compute the ratio of BN structures to MB structures for a
given number of variables.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We
review briefly BNs and MBs in Sections 2 and 3. In
Section 4, we derive a formula for counting MBs. In
Section 5 we compare the number of BN structures and
MB structures and in Section 6 we provide a summary of
the results.

2. BAYESIAN NETWORKS
A Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that
combines a graphical representation (the BN structure)
with quantitative information (the BN parameterization)
to represent a joint probability distribution over a set of
random variables. More specifically, a BN representing
the set of random variables Xi ε X in some domain
consists of a pair (G, ΘG). The first component G that
represents the BN structure is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) that contains a node for every variable in X and an
arc between a pair of nodes if the corresponding variables
are directly probabilistically dependent. Conversely, the
absence of an arc between a pair of nodes denotes
probabilistic independence between the corresponding
variables. Each variable Xi is represented by a
corresponding node labeled Xi in the BN graph, and in the

allowed between parents or between a parent and a spouse (see text).
this paper we use the terms node and variable
interchangeably. The second component ΘG represents
the parameterization of the probability distribution over
the space of possible instantiations of X and is a set of
local probabilistic models that encode quantitatively the
nature of dependence of each node on its parents. For
each node Xi there is a local probability distribution (that
may be discrete or continuous) defined on that node for
each state of its parents. The set of all the local probability
distributions associated with all the nodes comprises a
complete parameterization of the BN. Note that the phrase
BN structure refers only to the graphical structure G,
while the term BN (model) refers to both the structure G
and a corresponding set of parameters ΘG.
The terminology of kinship is used to denote various
relationships among nodes in a BN. These kinship
relations are defined along the direction of the arcs.
Predecessors of a node Xi in G, both immediate and
remote, are called the ancestors of Xi. In particular, the
immediate predecessors of Xi are called the parents of Xi.
In a similar fashion, successors of Xi in G, both immediate
and remote, are called the descendants of Xi, and, in
particular, the immediate successors are called the
children of Xi. A node Xj is termed a spouse of Xi if Xj is a
parent of a child of Xi. The set of nodes consisting of a
node Xi and its parents is called the family of Xi. An
example of a BN structure is given in Figure 1(a).

A formula for efficiently determining the number of BN
structures was first developed by Robinson (Robinson
1971; Robinson 1976), and independently by Stanley
(Stanley 1973). The number of BN structures that can be
constructed from n variables is given by the following
recurrence formula, where BN(n) is the number of DAGs
that can be constructed given n nodes:
( )

∑(

and denotes the number of ways to choose k nodes from n
nodes.
Equation 1 is computed using dynamic programming,
namely, the values of BN(*) are computed only once, then
cached for whenever they are needed again.
The time complexity of computing Equation 1 is O(n2)
where n is the number of variables. From Equation 1, it
can be seen that BN(n) is computed from four terms: the
first term takes O(1) time, the second term which gives
the number of ways to choose k nodes from n nodes takes

O(n2) time, the third term takes O(n2) time and the fourth
term is retrieved in O(1) time from the cache. This
analysis assumes that all operations can be done in O(1)
time, which is probably a reasonable assumption for n
small enough that the operations do not cause an
arithmetic overflow or underflow. As n gets large, special
routines may be needed to handle operations on n, which
will increase the time complexity.

3. MARKOV BLANKETS
The MB of a variable Xi, denoted by MB(Xi), defines a set
of variables such that conditioned on MB(Xi), Xi is
conditionally independent of all variables outside of
MB(Xi). The minimal MB is a minimal set MB(Xi)
conditioned on which Xi is conditionally independent of
all variables outside of MB(Xi). As mentioned in the
introduction, we shall refer to the minimal MB as the MB.
Analogous to BNs, a MB structure refers only to the
graphical structure while a MB refers to both the structure
and a corresponding set of parameters. The MB structure
consists of the parents, children, and children’s parents of
Xi, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Different MBs that entail
the same factorization for the conditional distribution
P(Xi | MB(Xi)) belong to the same Markov equivalence
class. We define a MB structure specifically as a

representative member of a Markov equivalence class that
has no arcs between parents or between a parent and a
spouse.
With respect to a MB structure, the nodes of the BN can
be categorized into five groups: (1) the target node, (2)
parent nodes of the target, (3) child nodes of the target,
(4) spousal nodes, which are parent nodes of the children,
and (5) other nodes, which are not part of the MB. The
node under consideration is called the target node. A
parent node is one that has an outgoing arc to the target
node and may have additional outgoing arcs to one or
more child nodes. A child node is one that has an
incoming arc from the target node, may have additional
incoming arcs from parent nodes, spousal nodes and other
child nodes, and may have outgoing arcs to other child
nodes. A spousal node is one that has outgoing arcs to one
or more child nodes and has neither an incoming arc from
the target node nor an outgoing arc to it. An other node is
one that is not in the MB and is considered to be a
potential spousal node, as we explain below. An example
demonstrating the various types of nodes in a MB
structure is given in Figure 1(b). As mentioned earlier, in
a MB structure we disallow arcs between parent nodes,
arcs between parent nodes and spousal nodes and arcs
between child nodes and other nodes.

4. COUNTING MARKOV BLANKET
STRUCTURES
We now derive of a formula for counting the number of
distinct MB structures with respect to a target variable.
The number of possible MB structures for a domain with
n variables is given by the following equation:
( )
∑

∑ (

( )

(

)

)

( )
(2)

where, np is number of parent nodes, nc is the number of
child nodes, nso is the number of spousal and other nodes,
and BN(nc) is the number of DAGs that can be
constructed with nc nodes and is given by Equation 1.
Equation 2 is derived as follows. The terms inside the
double summation count the number of MB structures for

a specified number of np, nc and nso nodes. The first term
gives the number of ways n - 1 can be partitioned into np
parent nodes, nc child nodes and nso spousal and other
nodes; this term is sometimes called the multiplicity. The
second term gives the number of distinct MB structures
that differ only in the presence or absence of arcs from
parent nodes to child nodes. Each parent node can have an
arc to none, one or more child nodes for a total of 2 n c
distinct MB structures. For np parent nodes, the number of
distinct MB structures that differ only in the presence or
n n
absence of arcs from parent nodes to child nodes is 2 c p .
The third term gives the number of distinct MB structures
that differ only in the presence or absence of arcs from
spousal and other nodes to child nodes. This derivation is
similar to the derivation of the previous term. Each
spousal or other node can have an arc to none, one, or
more child nodes for a total of 2 n so distinct MB
structures. For nso spousal or other nodes, the number of
distinct MB structures that differ only in the presence or
absence of arcs from spousal or other nodes to child nodes
is 2 n c n so . The fourth and last term gives the number of
DAGs that can be constructed with nc child nodes. The
summation is carried over all possible values of np and
nso; selection of particular values for np and nso determines
the value of nc and hence no explicit summation is
required over the values of nc. Note that the number of
parent nodes, the number of child nodes, the number of

The number of MB structures is with respect to a single target node and is not a count of all MB structures
for all nodes. The last column gives the ratio of the two types of structures. Both BN(n) and MB(n) are
exponential in n.

As an example, for a domain containing three variables,
the number of BN structures is 25 and the number of MB
structures is 15 as given by Equations 1 and 2
respectively. Figure 2 shows all 25 BN structures and
