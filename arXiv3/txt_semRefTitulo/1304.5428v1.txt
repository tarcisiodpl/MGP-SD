. A family of mixed finite elements is proposed for solving the first order system of linear elasticity
equations in any space dimension, where the stress field is approximated by symmetric finite element tensors.
This family of elements has a perfect matching between the stress components and the displacement. The
discrete spaces for the normal stress σii , the shear stress σij and the displacement ui are span{1, xi },
span{1, xi , xj } and span{1}, respectively, on rectangular grids. In particular, the definition remains the
same for all space dimensions. As a result of these choices, the theoretical analysis is independent of the
spatial dimension as well. In 1D, this element is nothing else but the 1D Raviart-Thomas element, which
is the only conforming element in this family. In 2D and higher dimensions, they are new elements but of
the minimal degrees of freedom. The total degrees of freedom per element is 2 plus 1 in 1D, 7 plus 2 in 2D,
and 15 plus 3 in 3D. The previous record of the least degrees of freedom is, 13 plus 4 in 2D, and 54 plus 12
in 3D, on the rectangular grid. These elements are the simplest element for any space dimension.
The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error estimate of the family of finite elements are
proved for both pure displacement and traction problems. Numerical tests in 2D and 3D are presented to
show a superiority of the new element over others, as a superconvergence is surprisingly exhibited.

1. Introduction
The first order system of equations, for the symmetric stress field σ ∈ Σ := H(div, Ω, S) and the displacement field u ∈ V := L2 (Ω, Rn ), reads: Find (σ, u) ∈ Σ × V such that
(1.1)

(Aσ, τ ) + (divτ, u) = 0

(divσ, v) = (f, v)

∀τ ∈ Σ,

∀v ∈ V.

In 1D, one example of the problem (1.1) is the mixed formulation of the 1D Poisson equation; In 2D and
3D, the stress-displacement formulation based on the Hellinger-Reissner principle for the linear elasticity
can be regarded as a celebrated example of (1.1).
Because of the symmetry constraint on the stress tensor, σij = σji , it is extremely difficult to construct
stable conforming finite elements of (1.1) even if for 2D and 3D, as stated in the plenary presentation
to the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians by D. N. Arnold. Hence compromised works use
composite elements [6, 22], or enforce the symmetry condition weakly [2, 5, 11, 24, 27, 28, 29]. The
landmarks in this direction are the respective works of Arnold and Winther [8] and Arnold, Awanou, and

Winther [4]. In particular, a sufficient condition of the discrete stable method is proposed in these two
papers, which states that a discrete exact sequence guarantees the stability of the mixed method. Based
on such a condition, conforming mixed finite elements on the simplicial and rectangular triangulations are
developed for both 2D and 3D [1, 3, 4, 8]. In order to keep conformity the vertex degrees of freedom are in
particular employed in these conforming methods. To avoid the complexity of conforming mixed element
and also vertex degrees of freedom, new weak-symmetry finite elements [7, 16, 18, 19], non-conforming
finite elements [9, 21, 17, 23, 30, 31] are constructed. See also [15, 10] for the enrichment of nonconforming
elements of [21, 23] to conforming elements. However, most of these elements are difficult to be implemented;
numerical implementation can only be found in [13, 14, 31] so far, all in 2D.

Figure 2. The 3D element of this paper.
In this paper, a new family of minimal, any space-dimensional, symmetric, nonconforming mixed finite
elements for the problem (1.1) is constructed. It is motivated by a simple fact that, by (1.2), the derivative on
a normal stress component σii is only in xi direction; while those on σij are only in xi and xj directions. Thus,
the minimal finite element space for σii would be span{1, xi } on each n-dimensional rectangular element;
the minimal finite element space for σij would be span{1, xi , xj } on each n-dimensional rectangular element.
For the displacement (1.3), there is no derivative and the minimal finite element space would be the constant
space span{1}. The spaces are displayed in the right diagram in Figure 1 and in Figure 2. Surprisingly, it is
shown that these minimal finite element spaces can actually form a family of stable and convergent methods
for (1.1). However, the analysis herein has to overcome the difficulty to prove the discrete inf-sup condition,
one key ingredient for the stability analysis of the mixed finite element method [12], and the difficulty
related to nonconformity of the discrete spaces for the stresses. For both the elasticity problem and the
Poisson problem, the stability analysis of mixed finite element methods in literature is established by special
commuting properties of canonical interpolation operators defined by degrees of freedom of discrete stress
spaces, see, for instance, [1, 3, 4, 8] and [12]. To overcome the first difficulty, a new macro-element technique
is proposed to prove a Fortin Lemma for mixed methods under consideration. Note that the macro-element
technique is widely used to analyze the stability of mixed methods for the Stokes problem, see [12] and
references therein. However, it is not used to the elasticity problem before. For the pure displacement

SYMMETRIC MIXED FINITE ELEMENT

problem, an explicit constructive proof is also given for the discrete inf-sup condition. In order to deal with
the second difficulty, a superconvergence property of the consistency error is proved. The mathematical
elegance and beauty of this family of minimal elements is gestated within, besides the perfect matching,
the independence of the spatial dimension n. In n dimension, the constructive proof of the discrete inf-sup
condition can be divided into n steps of that for the 1D Raviart-Thomas element, and the consistency error
can be decomposed as n two-dimensional consistency errors (For 1D, there is no consistency error.)
The superiority of the family of elements over the existing elements in the literature is its simplicity and
high accuracy. In fact, a family of 2D rectangular, conforming elements, of which the lowest order has 45
stress and 12 displacement degrees of freedom per element, is proposed in [3]. A nonconforming mixed
finite element based on rectangular grids is proposed with 19 stress and 6 displacement degrees of freedom
on each element in [30]. Later on, a simplified mixed finite element on 2D rectangular grids is constructed
with 13 stress and 4 displacement degrees of freedom on each rectangle independently in [21, 31], see the
left diagram in Figure 1, which is the simplest rectangular element of first order in 2D in the literature so
far. Doubtless, the 2D element with 7 stress and 2 displacement degrees of freedom on each rectangle of
this paper is the simplest rectangular element, see the right diagram in Figure 1. Due to a perfect matching
(for symmetry constraint), the new element has much less degrees of freedom (dof) but a higher order of
approximation property, compared to previous elements [21, 30, 31]. This is confirmed by numerical results.
In 3D, the new element has only 15 stress plus 3 displacement dof on each element, much simpler than the
first order element, with 54 plus 12 dof per element, of [23]. Notice that the element of [23] is previously
the simplest rectangular element in 3D.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The minimal element in 2D is introduced in Section 2. The
well-posedness of the finite element problem, i.e. the discrete coerciveness and the discrete inf-sup condition,
is proved in Section 3 for the pure displacement problem. The optimal order convergence is shown in Section
4. The element is extended to any space-dimension in Section 5. In Section 6, the stability of the minimal
element is shown for the pure traction problem. Numerical results in 2D and 3D, including that for a pure
traction problem, are provided in Section 7, which show a superconvergence of the minimal elements herein.
2. A minimal element in 2D
The 2D element is presented separately in this section for fixing the main idea while the whole family will
be developed in Section 5. Also for simplicity we consider a pure displacement problem first. The analysis
for other boundary value problems will be given in Section 6.
Consider a pure displacement problem (and a pure traction problem in Section 6):

The domain is assumed to be a rectangle (it is straightforward that results can be extended to domains
which can be covered by rectangles), which is subdivided by a family of rectangular grids Th (with grid size

The set of all edges in Th is denoted by Eh , which is divided into two sets, the set Eh,H of horizontal edges
and the set Eh,V of vertical edges. Given any edge e ∈ Eh , one fixed unit normal vector n with components
(n1 , n2 ) is assigned. For each K ∈ Th , define the affine invertible transformation

where subscript S indicates a symmetric matrix stress, and

P1,1 (K) = span{1, x},
P1 (K) = span{1, x, y},

P1,2 (K) = span{1, y}.

The dimension of the space VK is 2, and that of ΣK is 7. The nodal degrees of freedom for (v1 , v2 ), σ11 ,
and σ22 , are
• the moment of degree 0 on K for v1 and v2 ;
• the moments of degree 0 on two vertical edges of K for σ11 ;
• the moments of degree 0 on two horizontal edges of K for σ22 ;

The nodal degrees of freedom for σ12 will be studied as follows. Locally P1 (K) is the space of linear
polynomials. Globally, let Wh be the P1 -nonconforming space on Th , which is first introduced in [25] as a
nonconforming approximation space to H 1 (Ω) on the quadrilateral mesh; see also [20]. To be exact, Wh is
the space of piecewise linear polynomials, which are continuous at all mid-edge points of triangulation Th .
Wh is the finite element space approximating function σ12 .
The global spaces Σh and Vh are defined by


σ11 σ12
Σh = { σ =
(2.4)

σ12 σ22
σ11 is continuous on all vertical interior edges,

σ22 is continuous on all horizontal interior edges,
σ12 is continuous at all mid-points of interior edges },

(2.5)

Vh = {v ∈ L2 (Ω, R2 ) | v|K ∈ V (K) for all K ∈ Th }.

Since σ11 is continuous on all vertical interior edges, the derivative ∂x σ11 is well-defined in L2 (Ω). However,
σ12 is not continuous on Ω so that ∂x σ12 and ∂y σ12 are not in L2 (Ω). Therefore the discrete stress space
Σh is a nonconforming approximation to H(div, Ω, S). So the discrete divergence operator divh is defined
elementwise with respect to Th ,
divh τ |K = div(τ |K ) ∀τ ∈ Σh .
The mixed variational form for (2.1a) is (1.1). The mixed finite element approximation of Problem (1.1)
reads: Find (σh , uh ) ∈ Σh × Vh such that
(
(Aσh , τ ) + (divh τ, uh ) = 0
∀τ ∈ Σh ,
(2.6)
(divh σh , v) = (f, v) ∀v ∈ Vh .
It follows from the definition of ΣK that divh τh are piecewise constant for any τh ∈ Σh , which leads to
divh Σh ⊂ Vh .
This, in turn, leads to a strong discrete divergence-free space:
(2.7)

Zh = {τh ∈ Σh | (divh τh , v) = 0

∀v ∈ Vh }

= {τh ∈ Σh | divh τh = 0 pointwise }.

SYMMETRIC MIXED FINITE ELEMENT

For the analysis, define the following broken norm:
kτ kH(divh ) = (kτ k20 + kdivh τ k20 )1/2

(2.8)

∀τ ∈ Σh .

The rest of this section is devoted to an alternative definition to Wh , the space for σ12 in Σh . The
dimension of the space P1 (K) is three, less than the number of edges or vertexes of element K. The discrete
shear stress σ12 is still defined by four vertex-value functionals, which are not linearly independent though.
A constraint can be posed on those four functionals if one defines a functional set N on P1 (K), cf. [25,
Lemma 2.1].
Here the idea from [20] of a frame for P1 (K) will be used. To this end, define the frame for the space

An interpolation operator Π12 , from H 2 (Ω) (i.e., some continuous functions) to Wh is needed. The

(x̂1,K̂ , ŷ1,K̂ ) = (−1, −1),

(x̂2,K̂ , ŷ2,K̂ ) = (1, −1),

(x̂3,K̂ , ŷ3,K̂ ) = (1, 1),

(x̂4,K̂ , ŷ4,K̂ ) = (−1, 1).
In the same fashion, the interpolation Π12 is defined on all K ∈ Th by

where (x, y) ∈ K, and (xi,K , yi,K ) are the four vertexes of K. As φ−1,−1 (0, −1) = φ1,−1 (0, −1) = 1/2, it
follows that

where e+ and e− are two sides of an edge e ∈ Eh , em is the mid-point of e, and e1 and e2 are two endpoints
of e. That is, Π12 σ12 is continuous at all mid-points of edges. For a vertex in Th ,
ci,j = (ih, jh),

0 ≤ i, j ≤ N, N = 1/h,

it may be shared by one, or two, or four elements K ∈ Th . The combination of the frame functions at the
vertex ci,j forms one global frame function φi,j . For example, at vertex c0,1 , as it is shared by two elements,

3. Well-posedness of the discrete problem in 2D
This section considers the well-posedness of the discrete problem (2.6), which needs the following two
conditions.
(1) K-ellipticity. There exists a constant C > 0, independent of the meshsize h such that
(3.1)

(Aτ, τ ) ≥ Ckτ k2H(divh )

∀τ ∈ Zh ,

where Zh is the divergence-free space defined in (2.7).
(2) Discrete B-B condition. There exists a positive constant C > 0 independent of the meshsize h, such
that
(3.2)

inf sup

v∈Vh τ ∈Σh

(divh τ, vh )
≥ C.
kτ kH(divh ) kvk0

Theorem 3.1. For the discrete problem (2.6), the K-ellipticity (3.1) and the discrete B-B condition (3.2)
hold uniformly. Consequently, the discrete mixed problem (2.6) has a unique solution (σh , uh ) ∈ Σh × Vh .
Proof. It follows from (2.7) that for all τ ∈ Zh , divh τ = 0. Thus k divh τ k0 = 0 and kτ kH(divh ) = kτ k0 .
Since the operator A is symmetric and positive definite, the K-ellipticity of the bilinear form (Aτ, τ ) follows.
It remains to show the discrete B-B condition (3.2). Since the usual technique based on canonical
interpolations operators for discrete stress spaces [4, 8] is inapplicable here, a constructive proof is adopted.
For convenience, suppose that the domain Ω is a unit square [0, 1]2 which is triangulated evenly into N 2
elements, {Kij }. For any v ∈ Vh , it can be decomposed as a sum,
(3.3)

vh =

N
X

Vij ϕij (x, y),

i=1 j=1

where ϕij (x) is the characteristic function on the element Kij , and Vij = (V1,ij , V2,ij ) = (vh |Kij ). A discrete
stress function τh ∈ Σh will be constructed with
divh τh = vh and kτh kH(divh ) ≤ Ckvh k0 .
The construction of τh is motivated by a simple proof of the inf-sup condition of the 1D Raviart-Thomas
element for the 1D Poisson problem. The shear stress τ12 can be taken zero, i.e., τ12 ≡ 0; the normal stress
τ11 (resp. τ22 ) of τh can be constructed so that it is independent of the second (resp. first) component of

SYMMETRIC MIXED FINITE ELEMENT

vh . In addition, τ11 (resp. τ22 ) can be a continuous piecewise linear function of the variable x (resp. y) and
a piecewise constant function of y (resp. x). Therefore, they are of form

error estimate of Theorem 4.1 and the consistency error estimate of Theorem 4.2.

Theorem 4.2. Assume that (σ, u) be the solution to the problem (1.1) with u ∈ H01 (Ω, R2 ) ∩ H 2 (Ω, R2 ).
Then,

Proof. It follows from the first equation of (1.1) that Aσ = 21 (∇u + ∇uT ) for the exact solution u ∈

A combination of these two estimates with (4.11) implies

By the inverse inequality,
(4.14)

|(Aσ, τh ) + (divh τh , u)| ≤ Ch|u|2 kτh k0 .

Theorem 4.3. Let (σ, u) ∈ Σ × V be the exact solution of problem (1.1) and (τh , uh ) ∈ Σh × Vh the finite
element solution of (2.6). Then
kσ − σh k0 ≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ),

kdivh (σ − σh )k0 ≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ),
ku − uh k0 ≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ).

Proof. Let
Zf = {τ ∈ Σh | (divh τ, v) = (f, v) ∀v ∈ Vh }.
The finite element solution σh is in Zf . Thus, for any τ ∈ Zf , it holds σh − τ ∈ Zh , i.e.,
divh (σh − τ ) = 0.
It follows from the K-ellipticity (cf. (3.1)) that, for all τ ∈ Zf ,
Ckσh − τ k20 ≤ (A(σh − τ ), σh − τ )

= (A(σ − τ ), σh − τ ) + (A(σh − σ), σh − τ )

= (A(σ − τ ), σh − τ ) − (Aσ, σh − τ ) − (divh (σh − τ ), uh )

= (A(σ − τ ), σh − τ ) − (Aσ, σh − τ )

solution γh ∈ Σh , cf. [12],
(4.16)

(divh γh , vh ) = (divh (σ − τh ), vh )

τh ∈Σh

τ ∈Σh

(Aσ, τ ) + (divh τ, u)

kτ kH(divh )

The first term on the right-hand side of (4.17) is the approximation error. The choice τh = Πh σ with
Theorem 4.1 gives its upper bound. The second term on the right-hand side of (4.17) is the usual consistency
error for the nonconforming finite element method, which has already been bounded in Theorem 4.2. A
combination of these two theorems implies
kσ − σh k0 ≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ),

kdivh (σ − σh )k0 ≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ).

By (4.14) and the error estimation of kσ −σh k0 , the triangle inequality plus v = Ph u (Ph is the L2 projection
into piecewise constant spaces) yield
ku − uh k0 ≤ ku − Ph uk0 + kPh u − uh k0

≤ Ch|u|2 + C(kσ − σh k0 + ku − Ph uk0 )
≤ Ch(kuk2 + kσk2 ).

That completes the proof of this theorem.
5. The minimal element in any spatial dimension
Assume the domain Ω is a unit hypercube [0, 1]n in the n-dimensional space, which is subdivided by a
uniform rectangular grid of N n cubes:
Th := {Ki1 ,i2 ,...,in = [(i1 − 1)h, i1 h] × · · · [(in − 1)h, in h],
1 ≤ i1 , · · · in ≤ N ; h = 1/N }.

The set of all (n − 1)-dimensional face hyperplanes of the triangulation Th that are perpendicular to the
axis xi is denoted by En−1,i . That is
En−1,i = {[(i1 − 1)h, i1 h] × · · · × [(ii−1 − 1)h, ii−1 h] × {ii h}

× · · · × [(in − 1)h, in h], 1 ≤ i1 , · · · in ≤ N, 0 ≤ ii ≤ N }.

The internal hyperplanes are denoted by
En−1,i (Ω) = En−1,i ∩ Ω.
The set of all (n − 2)-dimensional mid-surface hyperplanes (orthogonal to both xi and xj axes) are denoted
by
1
En−2,ij = {[(i1 − 1)h, i1 h] × · · · × {ii h} × · · · × {(ij − )h} × · · · ×

In addition, define En−2,ij (K) := En−2,ij ∩ ∂K for any K ∈ Th . In 2D, these sets are
E1,1 = {all edges in Th perpendicular to x1 },

E1,2 = {all edges in Th perpendicular to x2 },

E0,12 = {all mid-points of edges in Th }.
In 3D, they are

E2,i = {all squares in Th perpendicular to xi }, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3,

E1,ij = {all mid-square edges of squares in E2,i and E2,j ,
parallel to xk }, i 6= j 6= k ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

Some comments are in order for this family of minimal finite element spaces.

Remark 5.1. The normal stress τii is a constant on each (n − 1)-dimensional hyper-plane Ei ∈ En−1,i . In
addition, for the case n = 1, Σh is
{τ11 ∈ L2 (Ω, R)

τ |K ∈ span{1, x} is continuous at the nodes } ⊂ H 1 (Ω),

the 1D Raviart-Thomas space, which is the only conforming space in this family.
Remark 5.2. The dimension of the space
Σh,ij := {τij ∈ L2 (Ω, R)

τij |K ∈ span{1, xi , xj },

τij is continuous on Eij ∈ En−2,ij (Ω)}

is
N n−2 ((n + 1)2 − 1) = N n + 2N n−1 .
see [25] for more details for 2D.

As in 2D, the discrete displacement space is

(5.3)

Vh = {v ∈ L2 (Ω, Rn ) | v|K is a constant vector }.

In particular, the dof of the 3D mixed element is plotted in Figure 2.
In the n-dimension, since divh Σh ⊂ Vh , the K-ellipticity (3.1) is proved exactly the same way as in
2D. The explicit construction proof of the discrete B-B condition (3.2) can be divided into n essentially
1-dimensional construction proofs similar to that for the 1D Raviart-Thomas element of the 1D Poisson
equation, see Section 3 for more details for 2D. For the consistency error in (4.15), the proof remains the
same except there is a multiple summation instead of 2-index summation. All the analysis in 2D remains
the same for n-D.
6. The pure traction problem
This section considers the pure traction problem, i.e., the stress space is subject to zero Neumann
boundary condition while no boundary condition on the displacement. In practice, part of elasticity body
should be located, i.e, the displacement has a Dirichlet boundary condition on some non-zero measure
boundary. But the pure traction problem is the most difficult one in mathematical analysis. A similar
proof for Theorem 6.1 can prove it for partial displacement problems. For ease of presentation, details are

presented only for two dimensions. Note that the argument in any dimension is similar. The main idea is
to use the macro-element technique where we construct a mass-preserving quasi-interpolation operator.

on Γ = ∂Ω,

(u, v) = 0 ∀v ∈ RM.

By the same discretization of uniform square grid Th with h = 1/N as in §2, the finite element equations
(2.6) remain the same except the spaces are changed with boundary and rigid-motion free conditions:
(Aσh , τ ) + (divh τ, uh ) = 0
(divh σh , v) = (f, v)

Here me is the mid-point of an edge e, and Σh and Vh are defined in (2.4) and (2.5), respectively. The
earlier analysis remains the same except the discrete B-B condition (3.2) as the stress space Σh,0 is much
smaller than before.
Theorem 6.1. The following discrete B-B condition holds uniformly,
inf

sup

vh ∈Vh,0 σh ∈Σh,0

(divh σh , vh )
≥ C.
kσh kH(divh ) kvh k0

P
Proof. Let vh = ((vh )1 , (vh )2 ) = (vh )ij ϕij as in (3.3), where (vh )ij = ((vh )1,ij , (vh )2,ij ) is the constant
value of vh on square Kij . With the boundary condition on the stress, it is impossible to match (vh )1 by
∂x τ11 alone as in (3.4). That is, because the dof of (vh )1 is n2 − 1.5 (due to a mixed constraint with the
second component (vh )2 ), but the dof of {τ11 } is only n(n − 1). This indicates that the help from ∂y τ12 is
indispensable. But the traditional trick of interpolating smooth B-B stress function does not work here as
(τ12 ) does not have enough dof. In other words, the support of τ21 is non-local, at least on four neighboring
squares. Given vh , a discrete B-B stress function will be constructed in two steps. First, a macro-element
technique will produce a σ̃h globally so that vh − divh σ̃h is rigid-motion free on each (2 × 2) macro-element
K2i,2j,2h := [x2i , x2i+2 ] × [y2j , y2j+2 ]. In a second step, construct, macro-element by macro-element, a σ̄h
locally by internal dof only, so that divh σ̄h = vh − divh σ̃h .
To this end, define a local rigid-motion space on each macro-element K2i,2j,2h
Rij = span{φr1,ij , φr2,ij , φr3,ij },

(6.4)

where φr1,ij are defined in Figure 5, piecewise constant functions. Assume N is an even integer and decompose
vh into two parts, a local rigid-motion and a global rigid-motion-free part,

vh = ṽh + v̄h ,

ṽh = PL2 (Rij ) vh for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ N/2 − 1.

Figure 6. Interpolation nodes for the Scott-Zhang C 0 -Q1 Ih , IhE , cf. (6.7) and Ihc , cf. (6.8).
For the analysis, we need a mass-preserving quasi-interpolation operator. This will be achieved in four
steps. First, let Ih be the boundary-condition preserving Scott-Zhang operator from [26], which interpolates
H01 functions to C00 (Ω)-Q1 (Th ) functions, shown in Figure 6. Then, we correct the mid-point values of edges
of macro-elements to get a mass-preserving on each edge of each macro-element K2i,2j,2h . Let mE be the
mid-point of edge E of K2i,2j,2h , which is also a vertex of Th , define the associated nodal basis function of
the conforming bilinear element by
θE (q) = 0 for other vertexes q of Th .

where σ̄11,2i+1,2j+ 21 denotes the value of σ̄11 at ((2i+1)h, (2j + 12 )h) and other notations are defined similarly.
Note that the four mid-edge values of σ̄12 are the same. Here on each macro-element, [vh − divh σ̃h ] is in

This stability is obtained by the standard scaling argument as all norms on 5-dimensional space Mij are
equivalent.
The final σh for vh is defined as
σh = σ̄h + σ̃h .
As divh σh = vh , by (6.11) and (6.16), the discrete B-B condition holds uniformly.

Then, the true stress function σ and the load function f are defined by the equations in (1.1), for the given
solution u.
In the computation, the level one grid is the given domain, a unit square or a unit cube. Each grid is
refined into a half-size grid uniformly, to get a higher level grid, see the first column in Table 1. In Table 1,
the errors and the convergence order in various norms are listed for the true solution (7.2). Here and in rest
tables in the section, Ih is the usual nodal interpolation operator. For example, Ih u1 (xi + h/2, yj + h/2) =
u1 (xi + h/2, yj + h/2), Ih σ11 (xi , yj + h/2) = σ11 (xi , yj + h/2), and Ih σ12 = Π12 σ12 , defined in (2.9). An

order 2 convergence is observed for both displacement and stress, see Table 1. However, Theorem 4.3 only
shows the first order convergence. Further studies on this superconvergence should be performed.
The next example, (7.3), of Yi [31] is implemented for a comparison. The finite element errors and the
order of convergence are listed in Table 2. An order 2 convergence is again observed. Notice that, see
Figure 1, the minimal element of this paper has a much less dof than that of Yi, but has one order higher
of convergence.
