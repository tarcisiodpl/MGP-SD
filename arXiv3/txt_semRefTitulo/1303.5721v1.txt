Since exact probabilistic inference is intractable
in general for large multiply connected belief
nets, approximate methods are required. A
promising approach is to use heuristic search
among hypotheses (instantiations of the network)
to find the most probable ones, as in the TopN
algorithm. Search is based on the relative
probabilities of hypotheses which are efficient to
compute. Given upper and lower bounds on the
relative probability of partial hypotheses, it is
possible to obtain bounds on the absolute
probabilities of hypotheses. Best-first search
aimed at reducing the maximum error
progressively narrows the bounds as more
hypotheses are examined. Here, qualitative
probabilistic analysis is employed to obtain
bounds on the relative probability of partial
hypotheses for the BN20 class of networks
networks and a generalization replacing the noisy
OR assumption by negative synergy.
The
approach is illustrated by application to a very
large belief network, QMR-BN, which is a
reformulation of the Internist-! system for
diagnosis in internal medicine.

1 INTRODUCTION
Bayesian belief networks provide a tractable basis for
expressing uncertain knowledge at both qualitative and
quantitative levels, in a way that is formally sound and
intuitively appealing. They are already being used in a
wide variety of applications, including knowledge bases of
up to about one thousand nodes. A major obstacle to their
application for still larger applications is the limitations
of available algorithms for diagnostic inference. Exact
diagnostic inference in general belief networks has been
shown to be NP-hard (Cooper, 1991). Hence, there is
considerable interest in the development of methods that
provide greater efficiency at the cost of imprecision in the
results (Henrion, 1990b ).
There have been two main directions in which researchers
have sought efficient approximate algorithms. One

approach involves random sampling of network
instantiations, also known as stochastic simulation
(Henrion, 1988). The other involves search among the
space of instantiations (hypotheses) to find those that are
most probable. Cooper (I 984) employed this approach in
Nestor, to obtain the most probable hypotheses. Peng and
Reggia (1987a, I987b) and Henrion (1990a) developed
more powerful admissability heuristics to prune the search
tree, allowing more efficient search of BN20 networks,
that is bipartite networks consisting of independent
diseases, conditionally independent findings, and noisy
ORs, as descnoed in Section 3. These methods are
guaranteed to find the most probable composite
hypotheses, and their relative probabilities (ratio of
posterior probabilities of hypotheses). Peng and Reggia
(1989) and Henrion (1990a) also describe methods to
bound the absolute probabilities of the composite
hypotheses.
Peng and Reggia's approach to abductive reasoning is
based on the notion of minimal covering sets of diseases
which explain observed findings. They use logical
techniques initially to identify covering sets for the given
findings, and then use probabilistic methods to find the
most p robable hypotheses. This scheme assumes zero
leaks, that is that no findings can occur "spontaneously"
in the absence of any explicitly modelled cause. For the
QMR-BN application to be described here, and indeed
most medical problems, most findings have non-zero leak
rates due to false positives, and so an adequate diagnosis
does not necessarily all have to explain all observed
This makes the covering set approach
findings.
inapplicable.
Shimony and Charniak (1990) describe a search-based
method that finds the MAP (Maximum A-posteriori
Probability) assignments to general belief networks. They
show how any belief network can be converted to an
equivalent weighted boolean function DAG, and that
solving the best selection problem (minimum cost
assignment) for this network is equivalent to finding the
MAP assignment for the belief network. While the best
selection problem is also NP-hard, standard best-first
search can be relatively efficient in practice.

Search-Based Methods to Bound Diagnostic Probabilities in Very Large Belief Nets

If the results of diagnostic inference or abductive reasoning
are to be used as the basis for making decisions, for
example how to treat a patient, or what additional tests to
order, knowing the relative probabilities of the most
likely complete hypothesis is not enough. We want to
know the absolute probabilities, or at least have bounds
on them, and we want often want to know the marginal
posterior probabilities of individual diseases, or of one or
two diseases, rather than of complete assignments which
include instantiations of all the other nodes.
To obtain bounds on the absolute probabilities, we need
bounds on the relative probabilities of all the hypothesis
that we have not explicitly examined in the search. That is
we want to find bounds on the sum of the relative
probabilities of the possible extensions of a given
hypothesis. Given bounds on the relative probabilities of
all hypotheses, we can compute bounds on the absolute
probabilities. However, to find such bounds requires
additional knowledge of properties of the network.
Qualitative knowledge about influences (Wellman, 1990;
Wellman & Henrion, 1991) is a useful source of
information to obtain bounds, as we shall see.
This paper presents improvements and generalizations to
the TopN algorithm. First, I will describe the QMR-BN
belief network which is the application providing a
context and motivation for this work on algorithm design.
I then describe a generalization of the noisy-OR
assumption of the BN20 networks, to negative product
synergy. This forms a basis for generalized bounding
theorems, including a new lower bound, that provides a
significant improvement on TopN as presented in Henrion
(1990b). Qualitative probabilistic analysis, using signs
of influence and synergies, provides a clearer and more
general basis for obtaining these. I then describe a method
to obtain bounds on the posterior probability of
hypotheses and for individual diseases. Finally, I present
results from application to the QMR-BN network,
showing progressive improvement as search is extended.
2 QMR AND INTERNIST -1

QMR (Quick Medical Reference) is a knowledge-based
system for supporting diagnosis by physicians in internal
medicine (Miller et a/, 1986). It is a successor to the
Internist-! system (Miller et a/, 1982). The version of the
knowledge-base used here contains information for 576
diseases (of the estimated 750 diseases comprising internal
medicine) and over 4000 manifestations, such as patient
characteristics, medical history, symptoms, signs, and
laboratory results. In this paper, these are referred to
generically as findings. QMR contains over 40,000
disease-finding associations. It represents about 25 person­
years of effort in knowledge engineering and is one of the
most comprehensive structured medical knowledge-bases
currently existing.
The knowledge-base consists of a profile for each disease,
that is, a list of the findings associated with it. Each such
association between disease d and finding/ is quantified by
two numbers: The evoking s trength is a number between

0 and 5 which answers the question "Given a patient with
finding f, how strongly should I consider disease d to be
its explanation?". The frequency is a number between 1
and 5 answering the question "How often does a patient
with disease d have finding f?". Associated with each
finding f is an import, being a number between 1 and 5
answering "To what degree is one compelled to explain
the presence of finding/ in any patient?".
3 QMR-BN: A PROBABILISTIC
INTERPRETATION OF QMR

The aim of this project1 is to develop a coherent
probabilistic interpretation of QMR, which we call QMR­
BN (for Belief Network), and eventually a version with
treatment decisions and cost or value models, which we
call QMR-DT (for Decision Theory). The first goal is to
improve the consistency of the knowledge base and to
explicate the independence assumptions it incorporates. A
second goal is to provide a challenging example to
develop and test new algorithms for probabilistic
reasoning. The current version is a reformulation of the
Internist-! knowledge-base. See Henrion (1990a), Shwe et
a/, (1991) and Middleton et a/, (1991) for more details.
Diseases

Figure 2: BN20 Belief net
A probabilistic representation can be divided into two
aspects: The framework of qualitative assumptions about
dependence and indcpendences, and the quantification of the
probabilities within that framework. QMR-BN currently
follows INTERNIST-I and QMR in assuming that all
diseases and findings are binary variables, being either
present or absent, without intermediate values. The initial
qualitative formulation incorporates the following
assumptions, expressed by the belief net in Figure 2:
Assumption 1 (MID): Diseases

Assumption 3 (LNOG): The effects of multiple
diseases on a common finding are combined as a Leaky
Noisy OR Gate. Suppose S df is the link event that
disease d is sufficient to cause finding f. 2 The noisy OR
assumption is that finding f will occur if any link event
occurs linking a present disease to f, and that these link
events are independent. (This is sometimes known as
causal independence.) With a leaky noisy OR an additional
leak event Lt is possible, which can cause f to occur even

prevalence rates for each disease, a quantity with no
correspondence in the INTERNIST-1/QMR knowledge
base. These were estimated from data compiled by the
National Center for Health Statistics on the basis of
hospital discharges, conditional on the specified
demographic (age and sex) categories. In summary, the
qualitative independence assumptions of BN20, together
with the link probabilities, leak probabilities, and disease
probabilities conditional on age and sex, specify a
reformulation of QMR in coherent probabilistic form.

with no explicit disease present.

Definition 1 (BN20): The class of bipartite belief
nets conforming to Assumptions 1, 2 and 3, are termed
BN20.
Some of the findings in INTERNIST-!, such as the
demographics or family history of a patient, are not
actually caused by diseases, but rather circumstances or
risk factors that may affect disease probabilities. These
variables should rearranged for ease of assessment so that
they influence the diseases rather than vice versa.
Currently, we have done this with age and sex as
represented in figure 3.

Demographic factors

4 INFERENCE ALGORITHMS
Given this BN20 representation, is there a tractable
method for diagnostic inference? To compute the exact
posterior probability of any hypothesis, we need to
compute the sum of relative probabilities of all
hypotheses. Since the set of complete hypotheses (disease
combinations) is the powerset of the set of diseases and
has cardinality of z576, this may seem a rather daunting
prospect. We have explored at least three different
approaches for diagnostic inference for this class of
networks. These include an exact method (Quickscore),
and two approximate methods, one using a forward
sampling or simulation scheme, (l ikelih ood weighting),
and one using search of the hypothesis tree with
probability bounding (TopN).
The QuickScore algorithm (Heckerman, 1989) uses an
ingenious rearrangement of the summation.
Its
complexity is polynomial in the number of diseases but is
exponential in the number of findings observed. In
practice it can score cases with 12 findings in about 10
minutes (Lightspeed Pascal on a Mac IIci), but it becomes
too slow if there are many more findings. Since BN20
has large numbers of intersecting loops, exact methods
seem unlikely to be tractable for larger problems.

Findings
Figure 3: Belief net with causative
factors and disease dependencies.
The second stage is to assign probabilities to this
framework, either derived from the QMR numbers, or
elsewhere. Heckerman & Miller (1986) have demonstrated
a fairly reliable monotonic correspondence between the
frequency numbers and P(ffd), the link probabilities of a
finding f given only disease d. Since there are over
40,000 frequencies in QMR, the ability to use a direct
mapping does a great deal to ease the reformulation
process by avoiding the need to reassess all the disease­
finding relationships. We have also developed a mapping
from imports to leak probabilities. Finally, our
probabilistic representation requires prior probabilities or

2 Reggia and Peng (1987a) term this the causation event and
notate it as f:d.

Likelihood weighting (Shachter & Peot, 1989; Fung &
Chang, 1989) is a development of logic sampling
(Henrion, 1988) in which each randomly generated
hypothesis is weighted by the likelihood of the observed
findings conditional on the hypothesis. Further efficiency
is achieved by using importance sampling, in which the
sampling probabilities of diseases are iteratively adjusted
to reflect the evolving estimate of their actual
probabilities. The S algorithm (Shwe & Cooper, 1990)
initializes the probabilities with a version of tabular Bayes
(assuming mutual exclusivity of diseases) as a starting
point for sampling. This version converges to reasonable
estimates of the posterior probabilities in about 40,000
samples taking an average of 94 minutes for the SAM
cases (on a Macintosh Ilci).
The TopN algorithm takes a quite different approach,
searching among hypotheses, that is complete
instantiations of the diseases. It relies for its efficiency on
576
the assumption that of the vast (z
for QMR-BN) set of
possible hypotheses, only a tiny fraction of them account
for most of the probability mass. Hypotheses with more
than a few diseases (five or six at most) have negligible
probabilities, since the improbability of that many

Search-Based Methods to Bound Diagnostic Probabilities in Very Large Belief Nets

diseases rapidly outweighs any possible improvement in
explaining the observed findings. The second key idea is
that, even though computing the absolute posterior
probability of a hypothesis is intractable in general
(requiring summing over all hypotheses), it is easy to
compute the relative probabilities of two hypotheses (see
also Cooper 1984; de Kleer & Williams, 1986; and Peng
& Reggia 1987a). The third key element i s an
admissability heuristic to prune paths that cannot led to
the most probable hypothesis (or most probable N
hypotheses, hence the name TopN), so that only a small
part of the space need be searched. A fourth element are
some theorems that allow bounding of the sum of relative
probabilities of all extensions of each hypothesis, and
hence allow obtaining bounds on the absolute
probabilities of hypotheses without examining them all.
In the following I will give more detail on these, with
some extensions and generalizations of previous results.
5 NOTATION:

I will use the common convention that lower case letters,
such as d, refer to variables, with uppercase, D and D,
referring to the events d=true and d=false, respectively.
Analogously, if h is a set of diseases, then H denotes the
event that all diseases in h are true (present), and JH[
denotes the event that all diseases in h are false (absent): 2
H= U D, G= U D
VdEh

Given a set of diseases, 6= { d!, dz, ... dn), a complete
hypothesis is an event that assigns a value, true or false,
to every disease in 6. A partial hypothesis assigns a
6,

leaving the

rest unspecified. If hc6, then H is a partial hypothesis,
since diseases not in h remain unspecified.
Adjacency of events denotes conjunction. So the event
HG specifies that all diseases in h are present, all those in
g

are absent, and the rest unspecified. (We assume hng =

0.)
Underlining makes a complete hypothesis from a partial
one, assigning absent to all diseases not specified. Thus H
denotes the event that all diseases in h are present and all
others in 6 absent:
H = U Du U D
VdEh

We define h0=0 as the empty set of diseases, and H o is

the corresponding event that no disease from 6 is present.
The relative probability of a hypothesis H is the ratio of
the posterior probability of H given findings F to the
posterior probability of hypothesis Ho:

R(H)
P(H F)
P(H I F)

Rili
P(Ho F)
P(Hol F)

Vd<�.h

[1]

TopN starts its search from h0, extending it by adding one
disease at a time. To generate the next candidate
hypothesis, it adds to the current hypothesis the disease
which leads to the largest relative probability. To identify
the n most probable hypotheses (hence "TopN"), it
applies an admissibility heuristic, which abandons a
search path when it provably cannot lead to any
hypothesis more probable than the nth best so far.
TopN's admissibility criterion is based on the concept of
Marginal Explanatory Power (MEP).
Definition (MEP): The Marginal Explanatory Power
(MEP) of a disease d with respect to a hypothesis set of
diseases, h, is the ratio of the posterior probability of the
extended hypothesis hud to the posterior of h alone:
MEP(D, H) =

V dE g

MARGINAL EXPLANATORY POWER

P(HDI F) R(HD)

P(Hl F)

[2]

The MEP is a measure of the increase or decrease
(according to whether it is greater or less than 1) in the
degree to which the hypothesis explains the findings F due
to the addition of d. The use of the MEP as the basis of
an admissable search heuristic depends on the following
result (Henrion 1990a):
Theorem la (declining MEP): Given a BN20
network, for any disease d, and disease sets h and g, the
marginal explanatory power (MEP) of d with respect to h
cannot be less than the MEP of d for any extension hug,
i.e.
MEP(D, H)� MEP(D, HG)

[3]

When searching for the most probable hypothesis from
current hypothesis h, if MEP(D, H) � 1 then d can be
eliminated as a path for exploring as an extension to H,
since it cannot lead to a more probable hypothesis. It can
also be eliminated as a candidate for extending other
extensions of H. Thus the only diseases which need to be
considered as extensions of H are those for which MEP(D,
H)> 1.
7 NEGATIVE PRODUCT SYNERGY
AND THE MEP THEOREM

Note that lHI is not equivalent to H. the event that at least

one of the diseases in h is absent.

It turns out that Theorem I a does not require the leaky
noisy OR assumption 3 of BN20, assumed in Henrion

145

146

Henrion

(1990a); a weaker assumption, negative product synergy
will suffice. First, we define this property, and then show
the more general version of the theorem.
Definition 2a (two cause NPS): Suppose there are
two propositions, d and e, and other variable(s) x, that
influence finding F according to the conditional
probability distribution P(FI d ex), there is negative
product synergy in the influence of d and e on J, iff

[4]

We can now obtain a generalization of Theorem 1a, which
applies to BN2NPS:
Theorem lb (declining MEP): Given a B N 2 NPS
network, then, for any disease subsets x, y, z of .1., the
complete set of diseases, the marginal explanatory power
(MEP) of x with respect to z cannot be less than the MEP
of x for any extension yuz, i.e.
MEP(X, Z) � MEP(X, YZ)

Proof: Taking the ratio of the two sides, and
substituting the definition of MEP [2],

This is the condition required for disease d to "explain
away" the evidence F, that is, given F, there is a negative
influence between d and e (Henrion & Druzdzel, 1990):

MEP(X, Z)
MEP(X, YZ)

-

P(EID F x) � P(E I D F x) "iix.

[5]

It is simple to show that the noisy OR (with or without
leaks) exhibits negative product synergy, and so gives
rise to this explaining away phenomenon.
Wellman and Henrion ( 1991) generalize the definition of
product synergy for n-ary variables, and discuss its
relation to additive synergy. Here we generalize the
definition in a different way to apply where there are more
than two variables which together influence another
variable:
Definition 2b (n cause NPS): Consider a set .1. of
propositions which influence finding F, as specified by
conditional probability distribution P(Fit.). The influence
exhibits negative product synergy, iff for any sets of
propositions x,y,z�Ll. there is negative product synergy
between x andy given z, i.e.

Assumption 4 (POS): The influence of every disease
d on every finding f is positive, that is, for any set of
diseases h not containing d,
-

P(FIDH) � P(FIDH), "iihcll, where dE h
Since the inequality is weak, this also allows diseases and
findings to be unlinked (independent). Positive influence
from disease to finding is an automatic consequence of
Assumption 3, the leaky noisy ORs, but not of negative
product synergy.
We can now define a class of bipartite belief nets that
generalizes the leaky noisy OR of BN20 to positive links
with negative product synergy:
Definition 3 (BN2NPS): A bipartite network is said
to be BN2NPS if it satisfies Assumption 1 (marginally
independent diseases), Assumption 2 (conditionally
independent findings), Assumption 4 (positive links), and
negative product synergy (NPS) in the influence of the
diseases on each finding .

[S]

From the definition of n cause negative product synergy

Expanding P(.YZ) and P(XYZ) similarly in the second

with the entire ratio as �I. QED.
8 BOUNDS ON THE PROBABILITY OF
EXTENSIONS

We want not just to identify the most probable
hypotheses using their relative probabilities, but to obtain
bounds on their absolute probabilities. To do this we
need to obtain bounds on the relative probabilities of all
the extensions of hypotheses in the search tree, so that we
can put bound on the contributions of all the hypotheses
we do not examine explicitly.
So far we have considered only complete hypotheses, such
as H. The relative probability of a partial hypothesis H is
the sum of the relative probabilities of all complete
extensions of H, that is all complete hypotheses in which
all diseases in h are present, that is,
R(H) =

.LN.Qh R(,S)

[9]

We also need the relative probabilities of partial
hypotheses that contain excluded diseases, such as:
R(HG) =

L"i! s where gc::2.Qh R(,S),

[IOJ

where gC is the complement of g, i.e. the set of diseases
in L1 but not in g.

Search-Based Methods to Bound Diagnostic Probabilities in Very Large Belief Nets

The following result gives an upper bound for the relative
probability of a partial hypothesis h excluding diseases in
g. It gives it in terms of the relative probability of the
corresponding complete hypothesis and the MEP for
candidate extension diseases d with respect to h, which are
relatively easy to compute:
Theorem 2 (UBI):
R(HG) � R(ID fl[l+MEP(D, H)].
'v'dehug

[11]

Unfortunately the upper bound UBI is not always a good
guide when there are many diseases each of which can
explain a lot relative to Ho, i.e. MEP(D, H0)» 1. In the
beginning of the search in a case with twenty or more
positive findings, UB1 can be very large, for example
overflowing an 8 byte floating point number (> 1 0300 ),
unless computed as logs. An upper bound avoids this
tendency is given by:
Theorem 5 (UB2):
< R(ID +
R(HG) -

This follows from the observation that that at most there
is no overlap between the findings explained by each
disease, and so the MEP(D, H) for each disease d is the
same, no matter how many other diseases are in the
hypothesis h it is extending. It is a generalization of
Theorem 2 given in Henrion ( 1990c) for the BN20
assumptions. The complete proof relies on the Declining
MEP Theorem lb, and so it also follows from the more
relaxed BN2NPS assumptions.

R(H) provides a simple lower bound (LBl) for R(HG).
This bound would be attained if all proper extensions S::Jh
had probability R(S)=O (Henrion, 1990c).
An higher lower bound is given by the following:

R(ID

[12]

This follows from Assumption 4 of positive influences,
that extending a hypothesis h by disease d cannot reduce
the likelihood of evidence F, that is P(FIHD) :2: P(FI.!:D.
There are often diseases d which explain nothing more
than hypothesis h, that is for which P(FIHD)=P(FIH).
Since these diseases are independent of the rest conditional
on H, it is possible to factor out their contributions to a
partial hypothesis HG thus:

(Factoring independents):

where w= ( d : P(FIHD)=P(FI.!:D}.
This allows us to remove all such independent (non­
explanatory) diseases, w. from the candidate list as
extensions of h. while accounting for their contribution.
Note that some diseases have relatively high priors (e.g.
peptic ulcer with prior 1.6%) and so are not infrequently
among the top ten hypotheses even if there is no specific
evidence for them. Application of this result prevents
them from cluttering up the search process.

This is based on the observation that at most any
extension D to H will completely explain all findings,
that is P(FIDH) � 1. This bound is complementary to
UBI, with use early in the search in cases with many
positive findings.
9 SEARCH METHOD
The search uses a best-first approach, where "best" means
the candidate partial hypothesis with the greatest possible
contribution to uncertainty about the relative posterior
probability. This uncertainty is measured as the maximum
error, the difference between the lower bound 2 and the
least of the upper bounds:
MaxErr(h) = Min(UBl (h), UB2(h)) - LB2(h)

[14]

We order the candidate hypotheses by MaxErr and select
the top one as the next one to expand. This is the one for
which expansion has the largest scope for reducing its
contribution to the overall uncertainty about the relative
probability of all unsearched hypotheses. Each time a
hypothesis is expanded, this reduces the bounds on its
parents. Search terminates, either when the MaxErr is
less than a criterion, Pmin, expressed as a fraction of the
upper bound on the total relative probability, or when the
search runs out of space for the hypothesis tree. As in
most best-first or A* searches, the algorithm is liable to
be memory bound, running out of space before running
out of time.
10 OBTAINING ABSOLUTE
PROBABILITIES

So far we have obtained bounds on the relative probability
of a variety of partial hypotheses, including LBR(H),

The upper bound for this is when R(H) is at its upper
bound UBR(H) and R(Ho) is lower bound LBR(Ho ), but
note that since the partial hypothesis H0 includes H, we
need replace LBR(H) as a component of LBR(Ho) by the
the upper bound of H in the denominator too. Thus, we
get the upper bound on the posterior probability of H is:

memory space. ) Since the distributions of hypotheses,

TopN took an average of 18 seconds (maximum of just
over a minute) for the 12 SAM cases. The S sampling
algorithm was run for 40,000 samples to achieve adequate
convergence for the SAM cases, taking an average of 94
minutes on a Macintosh Ilci (about three times faster than
the machine used for the Quickscore and TopN runs).
In some cases the maximum probability bound is at or
near 1, and quite useless. But it turns out that the actual
accuracy of the "best estimate" probabilities is very good
when compared with the exact results from QuickScore,
with a mean standard error between of 1.2%. Thus it
appears that the bounds are highly conservative (much
larger than necessary) in most cases. This finding suggests
the sampled hypotheses are quite representative in terms of
disease probabilities of the unsampled ones. Of course this
may not always be true, but it suggests some interesting
conjectures about properties of the hypothesis population.
To examine the effect of computational effort on the error,
the precision for terminating search Pmin was varied by
factors of 10 from w-3 to I0-7. Decreasing Pm in
increases the number of hypotheses explored, and decreases
the maximum bound on the probability error. The
computation time is approximately linear in the number
of hypotheses examined, with 30,000 hypotheses taking
about 65 seconds on a plain Macintosh II. Figure 3 shows
the effect of increasing the number of hypotheses searched
on the error bound for the 16 SAM cases. Most converge
satisfactorily according to the error bound by 30,000
hypotheses, but four do not.

Number of hypotheses searched

Figure 3: Error bound as maximum probability unaccounted for as a
function of the extent of the search for 16 SAM cases.

Figure 3 illustrates how the uncertainty about the
computed probabilities decreases as the search of the
hypothesis tree is extended, that is as the cumulative
probability of all the hypotheses examined approaches
one. Thus TopN is an "any time" algorithm: If it is
stopped at any point after initialization, it will give
bounds on the posterior probabilities; and the longer it
runs, the narrower these bounds will be. Given an
estimate of the convergence rate, a meta-reasoner could
select the run-time to be allocated according to the urgency
of the diagnosis, the importance of precision, and the cost
of computing.
CONCLUSIONS
The QMR-BN belief network confronts us with the
general intractability of exact algorithms for diagnostic
inference. Search-based algorithms such as TopN appear a
promising approximate approach for such networks. They
may be seen as smarter than forward sampling techniques
in that they search specifically to find the most probable
instantiations. They rely on exact methods for bounding
the error in the resulting probabilities instead of the
statistical error estimation methods available for some
sampling techniques.
We have presented a variety of results that bound the
relative probabilities of partial hypotheses in BN20 and
BN2NPS networks. These results illustrate the value of
applying methods of qualitative probabilistic analysis,
based on knowledge of the signs of influences and
synergies. For the QMR-BN project, and no doubt others,
there remains a need to develop more general results, for
example for networks with prior dependences among
diseases. The generality of search-based methods for
bounding probabilities remains an open question. It
seems unlikely that the kind of bounding results used here
will be obtainable for completely general networks, but
some further generality may be obtainable from
knowledge of qualitative probabilistic properties of other
classes of network.
