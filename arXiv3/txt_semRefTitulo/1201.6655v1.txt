In evaluating prediction markets (and other crowd-prediction
mechanisms), investigators have repeatedly observed a socalled wisdom of crowds effect, which can be roughly summarized as follows: the average of participants performs
much better than the average participant. The market price—
an average or at least aggregate of traders’ beliefs—offers a
better estimate than most any individual trader’s opinion.
In this paper, we ask a stronger question: how does the
market price compare to the best trader’s belief, not just
the average trader. We measure the market’s worst-case log
regret, a notion common in machine learning theory. To arrive at a meaningful answer, we need to assume something
about how traders behave. We suppose that every trader
optimizes according to the Kelly criteria, a strategy that
provably maximizes the compound growth of wealth over
an (infinite) sequence of market interactions. We show several consequences. First, the market prediction is a wealthweighted average of the individual participants’ beliefs. Second, the market learns at the optimal rate, the market price
reacts exactly as if updating according to Bayes’ Law, and
the market prediction has low worst-case log regret to the
best individual participant. We simulate a sequence of markets where an underlying true probability exists, showing
that the market converges to the true objective frequency
as if updating a Beta distribution, as the theory predicts. If
agents adopt a fractional Kelly criteria, a common practical
variant, we show that agents behave like full-Kelly agents
with beliefs weighted between their own and the market’s,
and that the market price converges to a time-discounted
frequency. Our analysis provides a new justification for fractional Kelly betting, a strategy widely used in practice for
ad-hoc reasons. Finally, we propose a method for an agent
to learn her own optimal Kelly fraction.

INTRODUCTION

Consider a gamble on a binary event, say, that Obama
will win the 2012 US Presidential election, where every x
dollars risked earns xb dollars in net profit if the gamble
pays off. How many dollars x of your wealth should you risk
if you believe the probability is p? The gamble is favorable
if bp−(1−p) > 0, in which case betting your entire wealth w
will maximize your expected profit. However, that’s extraordinarily risky: a single stroke of bad luck loses everything.
Over the course of many such gambles, the probability of
bankruptcy approaches 1. On the other hand, betting a
small fixed amount avoids bankruptcy but cannot take advantage of compounding growth.
The Kelly criteria prescribes choosing x to maximize the
expected compounding growth rate of wealth, or equivalently to maximize the expected logarithm of wealth. Kelly
betting is asymptotically optimal, meaning that in the limit
over many gambles, a Kelly bettor will grow wealthier than
an otherwise identical non-Kelly bettor with probability 1
[1, 3, 7, 16, 17].
Assume all agents in a market optimize according to the
Kelly principle, where b is selected to clear the market. We
consider the implications for the market as a whole and
properties of the market odds b or, equivalently, the market probability pm = 1/(1 + b). We show that the market
prediction pm is a wealth-weighted average of the agents’
predictions pi . Over time, the market itself—by reallocating wealth among participants—adapts at the optimal rate
with bounded log regret to the best individual agent. When
a true objective probability exists, the market converges to
it as if properly updating a Beta distribution according to
Bayes’ rule. These results illustrate that there is no “price
of anarchy” associated with well-run prediction markets.
We also consider fractional Kelly betting, a lower-risk variant of Kelly betting that is popular in practice but has less
theoretical grounding. We provide a new justification for
fractional Kelly based on agent’s confidence. In this case,
the market prediction is a confidence-and-wealth-weighted
average that empirically converges to a time-discounted version of objective frequency. Finally, we propose a method
for agents to learn their optimal fraction over time.

KELLY BETTING

When offered b-to-1 odds on an event with probability p,
the Kelly-optimal amount to bet is f ∗ w, where
bp − (1 − p)
b
is the optimal fixed fraction of total wealth w to commit to
the gamble.
If f ∗ is negative, Kelly says to avoid betting: expected
profit is negative. If f ∗ is positive, you have an information
edge; Kelly says to invest a fraction of your wealth proportional to how advantageous the bet is. In addition to maximizing the growth rate of wealth, Kelly betting maximizes
the geometric mean of wealth and asymptotically minimizes
the mean time to reach a given aspiration level of wealth
[17].
Suppose fair odds of 1/b are simultaneously offered on the
opposite outcome (e.g., Obama will not win the election). If
bp − (1 − p) < 0, then betting on this opposite outcome is
favorable; substituting 1/b for b and 1 − p for p, the optimal
fraction of wealth to bet becomes 1 − p − bp.
An equivalent way to think of a gamble with odds b is as
a prediction market with price pm = 1/(1 + b). The volume
of bet is specified by choosing a quantity q of shares, where
each share is worth $1 if the outcome occurs and nothing
otherwise. The price represents the cost of one share: the
amount needed to pay for a chance to win back $1. In this
interpretation, the Kelly formula becomes
f∗ =

f∗ =

p − pm
.
1 − pm

The optimal action for the agent is to trade q ∗ = f ∗ w/pm
shares, where q ∗ > 0 is a buy order and q ∗ < 0 is a sell
order, or a bet against the outcome.
Note that q ∗ is the optimum of expected log utility
p ln((1 − pm )q + w) + (1 − p) ln(−pm q + w).

odds reached when all agents are optimizing, and supply
and demand are precisely balanced. Recall that the market’s
probability implied by
Pthe odds of b is pm = 1/(1 + b). We
will show that pm is i wi pi .

Payout balance

The first approach we’ll use is payout balance: the amount
of money at risk must be the same as the amount paid out.
Theorem 1. (Market Pricing) For all normalized agent
wealths wi and agent beliefs pi ,

pm =

Proof. To see this, recall that fi∗ = (pi − pm )/(1 − pm ) for
pi > pm . For pi < pm , Kelly betting prescribes taking the
other side of the bet, with fraction
(1 − pi ) − (1 − pm )
pm − pi

1 − (1 − pm )

So the market equilibrium occurs at the point pm where the
payout is equal to the payin. If the event occurs, the payin
is

Log utility maximization

wi = 1, we get the theorem.

An alternate derivation of the market prediction utilizes
the fact that Kelly betting is equivalent to maximizing expected log utility. Let q = x(b + 1) be the gross profit of an
agent who risks x dollars, or in prediction market language
the number of shares purchased. Then expected log utility
is
E[U (q)] = p ln((1 − pm )q + w) + (1 − p) ln(−pm q + w).
The optimal q that maximizes E[U (q)] is

MARKET MODEL

Suppose that we have a prediction market,
P where participant i has a starting wealth wi with
i wi = 1. Each
participant i uses Kelly betting to determine the fraction fi∗
of their wealth bet, depending on their predicted probability
pi .
We model the market as an auctioneer matching supply and demand, taking no profit and absorbing no loss.
We adopt a competitive equilibrium concept, meaning that
agents are ”price takers”, or do not consider their own effect
on prices if any. Agents optimize according to the current
price and do not reason further about what the price might
reveal about the other agents’ information. An exception
of sorts is the fractional Kelly setting, where agents do consider the market price as information and weigh it along
with their own.
A market is in competitive
at price pm if all

This theorem is extraordinarily general, as it applies to all

which is precisely the wealth computed above for the y = 1

Market Sequences

It is well known that Bayes’ law is the correct approach for
integrating evidence into a belief distribution, which shows
that Kelly betting agents optimally summarize all past information if the true behavior of the world was drawn from
the prior distribution of wealth.
Often these assumptions are too strong—the world does
not behave according to the prior on wealth, and it may act
in a manner completely different from any one single expert.
In that case, a standard analysis from learning theory shows
that the market has low regret, performing almost as well as
the best market participant.
For any particular sequence of markets we have a sequence
pt of market predictions and yt ∈ {0, 1} of market outcomes.

FRACTIONAL KELLY BETTING

Fractional Kelly betting says to invest a smaller fraction
λf ∗ of wealth for λ < 1. Fractional Kelly is usually justified
on an ad-hoc basis as either (1) a risk-reduction strategy,
since practitioners often view full Kelly as too volatile, or
(2) a way to protect against an inaccurate belief p, or both
[17]. Here we derive an alternate interpretation of fractional
Kelly. In prediction market terms, the fractional Kelly formula is
p − pm
.
λ
1 − pm
With some algebra, fractional Kelly can be rewritten as
p0 − pm
1 − pm
where
p0 = λp + (1 − λ)pm .

(3)

In other words, λ-fractional Kelly is precisely equivalent to
full Kelly with revised belief λp+(1−λ)pm , or a weighted average of the agent’s original belief and the market’s belief. In

this light, fractional Kelly is a form of confidence weighting
where the agent mixes between remaining steadfast with its
own belief (λ = 1) and acceding to the crowd and taking the
market price as the true probability (λ = 0). The weighted
average form has a Bayesian justification if the agent has a
Beta prior over p and has seen t independent Bernoulli trials
to arrive at its current belief. If the agent envisions that the
market has seen t0 trials, then she will update her belief to
λp + (1 − λ)pm , where λ = t/(t + t0 ) [9, 10, 12]. The agent’s
posterior probability given the price is a weighted average of
its prior and the price, where the weighting term captures
her perception of her own confidence, expressed in terms of
the independent observation count seen as compared to the
market.

Prices retain the form of a weighted average, but with

Proof. The proof is a straightforward corollary of Theorem 1.
In particular, we note that a λ-fractional Kelly agent of
wealth w bets precisely as a full-Kelly agent of wealth λw.
Consequently, we can apply theorem 1 with wi0 = Pλiλwiiwi

and p0i = pi unchanged.

MARKET DYNAMICS WITH STATIONARY OBJECTIVE FREQUENCY

The worst-case bounds above hold even if event outcomes
are chosen by a malicious adversary. In this section, we
examine how the market performs when the objective frequency of outcomes is unknown though stationary.
The market consists of a single bet repeated over the
course of T periods. Unbeknown to the agents, each event
unfolds as an independent Bernoulli trial with probability of
success π. At the beginning of time period t, the realization
of event Et is unknown and agents trade until equilibrium.
Then the outcome is revealed, and the agents’ holdings pay
off accordingly. As time period t + 1 begins, the outcome of
Et+1 is uncertain. Agents bet on the t + 1 period event until
equilibrium, the outcome is revealed, payoffs are collected,
and the process repeats.
In an economy of Kelly bettors, the equilibrium price is
a wealth-weighted average (2). Thus, as an agent accrues
relatively more earnings than the others, its influence on
price increases. In the next two subsections, we examine how
this adaptive process unfolds; first, with full-Kelly agents
and second, with fractional Kelly agents. In the former case,
prices react exactly as if the market were a single agent
updating a Beta distribution according to Bayes’ rule.

Market dynamics with full-Kelly agents

Figure 1.a plots the price over 150 time periods, in a
market composed of 100 Kelly agents with initial wealth
wi = 1/100, and pi generated randomly and uniformly on
(0, 1). In this simulation the true probability of success π
is 0.5. For comparison, the figure also shows the observed
frequency, or the number of times that E has occurred divided by the number of periods. The market price tracks
the observed frequency extremely closely. Note that price
changes are due entirely to a transfer of wealth from inaccurate agents to accurate agents, who then wield more power
in the market; individual beliefs remain fixed.
Figure 1.b illustrates the nature of this wealth transfer.
The graph provides a snapshot of agents’ wealth versus their
belief pi after period 15. In this run, E has occurred in 10
out of the 15 trials. The maximum in wealth is near 10/15 or
2/3. The solid line in the figure is a Beta distribution with
parameters 10 + 1 and 5 + 1. This distribution is precisely
the posterior probability of success that results from the
observation of 10 successes out of 15 independent Bernoulli
trials, when the prior probability of success is uniform on
(0,1). The fit is essentially perfect, and can be proved in the
limit since the Beta distribution is conjugate to the Binomial
distribution under Bayes’ Law.
Although individual agents are not adaptive, the market’s composite agent computes a proper Bayesian update.
Specifically, wealth is reallocated proportionally to a Beta
distribution corresponding to the observed number of successes and trials, and price is approximately the expected
value of this Beta distribution.1 Moreover, this correspondence holds regardless of the number of successes or failures,
or the temporal order of their occurrence. A kind of collective Bayesianity emerges from the interactions of the group.
We also find empirically that, even if not all agents are
Kelly bettors, among those that are, wealth is still redistributed according to Bayes’ rule.

Market dynamics with fractional Kelly agents

In this section, we consider fractional Kelly agents who,
as we saw in Section 2, behave like full Kelly agents with
belief λp + (1 − λ)pm . Figure 2.a graphs the dynamics of
price in an economy of 100 such agents, along with the observed frequency. Over time, the price remains significantly
more volatile than the frequency, which converges toward
π = 0.5. Below, we characterize the transfer of wealth that
precipitates this added volatility; for now concentrate on the
price signal itself. Inspecting Figure 2.a, price changes still
exhibit a marked dependence on event outcomes, though at
any given period the effect of recent history appears magnified, and the past discounted, as compared with the observed
frequency. Working from this intuition, we attempt to fit
the data to an appropriately modified measure of frequency.

The wealth distribution is significantly more evenly
dispersed than the corresponding Beta distribution.

Figure 2.b illustrates a very close correlation between discounted frequency, with γ = 0.96 (hand tuned), and the
same price curve of Figure 2.a. While standard frequency
provides a provably good model of price dynamics in an
economy of full-Kelly agents, discounted frequency (5) appears a better model for fractional Kelly agents.
To explain the close fit to discounted frequency, one might
expect that wealth remains dispersed—as if the market’s
composite agent witnesses fewer trials than actually occur.
That’s true to an extent. Figure 3 shows the distribution of
wealth after 69 successes have occurred in 150 trials. Wealth
is significantly more evenly distributed than a Beta distribution with parameters 69+1 and 81+1, also shown. However,
the stretched distribution can’t be modeled precisely as another, less-informed Beta distribution.

LEARNING THE KELLY FRACTION

In theory, a rational agent playing against rational opponents should set their Kelly fraction to λ = 0, since, in a
rational expectations equilibrium [6], the market price is by
definition at least as informative as any agent’s belief. This
is the crux of the no-trade theorems [8]. Despite the theory
[5], people do agree to disagree in practice and, simply put,
trade happens. Still, placing substantial weight on the market price is often prudent. For example, in an online prediction contest called ProbabilitySports, 99.7% of participants
were outperformed by the unweighted average predictor, a
typical result.2
In this light, fractional Kelly can be seen as an experts
algorithm [2] with two experts: yourself and the market.
We propose dynamically updating λ according to standard
experts algorithm logic: When you’re right, you increase
λ appropriately; when you’re wrong, you decrease λ. This
gives a long-term procedure for updating λ that guarantees:
• You won’t do too much worse than the market (which
by definition earns 0)
• You won’t do too much worse than Kelly betting using
your original prior p

DISCUSSION

We’ve shown something intuitively appealing here: selfinterested agents with log wealth utility create markets which
learn to have small regret according to log loss. There are
two distinct “log”s in this statement, and it’s appealing to
consider what happens when we vary these. When agents
have some utility other than log wealth utility, can we alter
the structure of a market so that the market dynamics make
the market price have low log loss regret? And similarly if
we care about some other loss—such as squared loss, 0/1
loss, or a quantile loss, can we craft a marketplace such that
log wealth utility agents achieve small regret with respect to
these other losses?
What happens in a market without Kelly bettors? This
can’t be described in general, although a couple special cases
are relevant. When all agents have constant absolute risk
aversion, the market computes a weighted geometric average of beliefs [10, 11, 13]. When one of the bettors acts
according to Kelly and the others in some more irrational
fashion. In this case, the basic Kelly guarantee implies that
the Kelly bettor will come to dominate non-Kelly bettors
with equivalent or worse log loss. If non-Kelly agents have
a better log loss, the behavior can vary, possibly imposing
greater regret on the marketplace if the Kelly bettor accrues
the wealth despite a worse prediction record. For this reason, it may be desirable to make Kelly betting an explicit
option in prediction markets.
