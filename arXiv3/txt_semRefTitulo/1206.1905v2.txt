We determine the non-linear hydrodynamic response to geometrical fluctuations in heavy ion
collisions using ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. This response is characterized with a set of nonlinear response coefficients that determine, for example, the v5 that is produced by an 2 and an 3 .
We analyze how viscosity damps both the linear and non-linear response coefficients, and provide
an analytical estimate that qualitatively explains most of the trends observed in more complete
simulations. Subsequently, we use these non-linear response coefficients to determine the linear and
non-linear contributions to v1 , v4 and v5 . For viscous hydrodynamics the non-linear contribution is
dominant for v4 , v5 and higher harmonics. For v1 , the non-linear response constitutes an important
∼ 25% correction in mid-central collisions. The non-linear response is also analyzed as a function
of transverse momentum for v1 , v4 and v5 . Finally, recent measurements of correlations between
event-planes of different harmonic orders are discussed in the context of non-linear response.

INTRODUCTION

The goal of the RHIC and the LHC heavy ion programs is to produce and to characterize
the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a prototype for non-abelian plasmas. One of the best ways
to understand the transport properties of the experimentally produced plasma is through
anisotropic flow [1–3]. In a heavy ion collision the nuclei pass through each other, and the
resulting energy density in the transverse plane fluctuates in coordinate space from event to
event. If the mean free path is short compared to the system size, the produced plasma will
respond as a fluid to the pressure gradients and convert these coordinate space fluctuations
to long range momentum space correlations between the produced particles. In the last two
years it was gradually realized [4–6] that all of the long range momentum-space correlations
known colloquially as the “ridge” and “the Mach cone” are manifestations of this collective
flow [7, 8]. This realization gave rise to a large variety of flow observables which provide
an unprecedented experimental check of the overall correctness of the hydrodynamic picture
of heavy ion events [7, 9–11]. Further, different observables have different sensitivity to
the shear viscosity of the plasma [12], and therefore a global analysis of flow can provide
cross-correlated constraints on η/s.
One of the most direct measurements is the harmonic spectrum of the produced particles.
The final state momentum spectrum for each event can be expanded in harmonics

where φp is the azimuthal angle of the produced particles and Ψn is the event plane angle1 .
The averaged square of these harmonics, i.e. hhvn2 ii, can be measured experimentally by
studying two particle correlations [1]. There is strong experimental and theoretical evidence
that the harmonic coefficients, v2 and v3 , are to a good approximation linearly proportional
to the deformations in the initial energy density in the transverse plane. For example, the
experimental ratio hhv32 ii / hhv22 ii closely follows the geometric deformations hh23 ii / hh22 ii as a
function of centrality [7]. Event-by-event simulations with ideal hydrodynamics reproduce
this trend, and show that the event plane angles Ψ2 and Ψ3 are strongly correlated with the
angles of the initial deformations [13].
However, in an insightful paper Gardim et al [14] studied the correlation between higher
harmonics, v4 and v5 , and the initial spatial deformations within ideal hydrodynamics. This
work explained and quantified the extent to which the higher harmonics such as v4 and
v5 arise predominantly from the non-linearities of the medium response. For example, for
mid-central collisions the observed v5 is predominantly a result of the interactions between
v2 and v3 . This work was motivated in part by previous event-by-event simulations by
Heinz and Qiu [13] which showed that Ψ4 and Ψ5 are uncorrelated with the fourth and
fifth harmonics of the spatial deformation. Based on the centrality dependence of this
decorrelation, these authors anticipated (but did not quantify) the importance of v2 -v3 modemixing in determining v5 .
The goal of this work is to systematically characterize the non-linear response of the
medium. First, in Section II we introduce a set of non-linear response coefficients, and

Following tradition, we have expanded the particle distribution in terms of cosines and phases Ψn rather
than cosines and sines.

describe how these coefficients can be used in conjunction with a Glauber model to determine
hhvn2 ii. The strongest non-linear response stems from the interactions between v2 and the
other harmonics, and consequently a prominent response coefficient is w5(23) /2 3 , which
determines the v5 produced by an elliptic and triangular deformation. In Section III B we
determine these response coefficients using both ideal and viscous hydrodynamics, and study
how the response depends on the shear viscosity. With these non-linear coefficients, together
with the linear response, we make several predictions for v1 , v4 , and v5 in ideal and viscous
hydrodynamics in Section IV. Finally, in Section IV we also study the transverse momentum
dependence of v1 , v4 , and v5 .
In this work we will determine the harmonic spectrum by characterizing the quadratic
response of the system to small deformations. Alternatively, one could simply run hydrodynamics event-by-event and compute the averages that are needed to compare to experiment
[13, 15–19]. While event-by-event hydrodynamics is the best for this pragmatic purpose, the
framework of non-linear response can yield valuable insight into the physics of these rather
involved simulations.

NON-LINEAR RESPONSE
A.

The cumulant expansion

In hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions the medium is first modeled with
an initial state Glauber model, then is evolved with hydrodynamics, and finally the particle
spectrum is computed by making kinetic assumptions about the fluid. The final state particle
spectrum for each event can be expanded in harmonics

where hh. . .ii denotes the average over events.
In the next sections we will describe how the momentum space response is related to the
initial state geometry. To this end, the spatial distribution of the initial entropy density in
the transverse plane,
τ0 s(x)
ρ(x) ≡ R 2
,
(2.3)
d x τ0 s(x)
is quantified with a cumulant expansion [9], where x = (x, y) = (r cos φ, r sin φ) are the
coordinates in the transverse plane and τo is the initial Bjorken time [20]. Specifically the
n, m-th moment of the entropy distribution is defined as
Z
ρn,m ≡ d2 x ρ(x) (r2 )(n−m)/2 rm eimφ ,
(2.4)

where (n − m)/2 is typically an integer. This moment is closely related to the n, m-th
cumulant Wn,m
Wn,m ∝ ρn,m − contractions .
(2.5)
The meaning of eq. (2.5) will be clarified through examples, with additional details about
the cumulant expansion relegated to the literature [9, 21]. The radial variation of ρ(x) is

quantified by the radial cumulants, hr2 i and hr4 i − 2 hr2 i , while the the azimuthal variation

Here h. . .i denote an average over ρ(x) for a single event, and Φ1 , Φ2 and Φ3 are the

For the lowest harmonics the azimuthal cumulants and the azimuthal moments coincide,
and these definitions will appear obvious to most readers. For the fourth harmonic and
higher, we will depart from traditional moment based definition, and quantify the deformations with cumulants rather than moments2

B.

Non-linear response to the cumulants

We expect the response of the system to be dominated by the lowest cumulants. Motivated by Fourier analysis [9], we replace the general distribution ρ(x) with a Gaussian,
eq. (2.10), whose second moments have been adjusted to reproduce hr2 i = σx2 + σy2 and
2 = (σy2 − σx2 )/(σx2 + σy2 ). In Ref. [9] we showed that a Gaussian + fourth order cumulants
reproduces the results of smooth Glauber initial conditions in detail. If a Gaussian with a
non-negligible 2 is simulated, the particle spectrum produced by this background contains
all even harmonics

(2.13)

For small 2 the response coefficient w2 describes the linear response to the deformation and
is proportional to 2 , while w4(22) describes the non-linear response and is proportional to
22 . Below, we will assume that 2 is small enough that this scaling with 2 applies. Further,
we have truncated the expansion in eq. (2.13) at quadratic order in 2 , and will continue
to do this implicitly from now on. The working assumption in this paper is that the most
important non-linearity stems from the almond shape of the background.
If the Gaussian distribution is perturbed by a small fourth order cumulant C4 ei4Φ4 , then
the resulting particle spectra will be described by

(2.14)

where w4 captures the linear response to the fourth order cumulant and is proportional to
C4 for small C4 . In writing eq. (2.14) we have neglected terms proportional to C4 2 , which
can contribute to v2 and reduce the perfect correlation between Ψ2 and Φ2 . Comparing
eq. (2.14) with the definition of v4 , eq. (2.1), we see that v4 is determined by the linear and
quadratic response
v4 e−i4Ψ4 = w4 e−i4Φ4 + w4(22) e−i4Φ2 .
(2.15)
Squaring this result and averaging over events we see that
v4 {2} ≡

.

(2.16)

In writing eq. (2.14) we have neglected the non-linear contributions of 1 and 3 to v4 since
v3 and v1 are small compared to v2 for mid-peripheral collisions.
Similarly, if the Gaussian background distribution is perturbed by a third order cumulant
and a fifth order cumulant C5 , then v5 is determined by a combination of the linear and
non-linear response. The response to C5 is small [12], and therefore we will neglect the
non-linearities due to 2 C5 , but we will keep the non-linearities due to 2 3 . With this
approximation scheme the particle spectrum through quadratic order reads

(2.18)

which is clearly analogous with v4 case. Finally, if the distribution has a net dipole asymmetry 1 , then v1 is given a combination of the linear and non-linear response
v1 {2} =

|w1 e−iΦ1 + w1(23) e−i(3Φ3 −2Φ2 ) |2

(2.19)

where w1 notates the linear response to 1 . In writing this result for v1 we have neglected the
non-linear interaction between v1 and v2 , i.e. w1(21) . Thus eq. (2.19) makes the simplifying
assumption that v1 is small compared to v3 , while a more complete treatment would include
a w1(21) contribution.
Let us discuss how this formalism can be used to study the pT dependence of the flow.

The phase angle Ψn (pT ) is often assumed to equal Ψn . Using the formalism outlined above
we write v1 (pT ) as a sum of the linear and non-linear response
v1 (pT )e−iΨ1 (pT ) = w1 (pT )e−iΦ1 + w1(23) (pT )e−i3Φ3 +i2Φ2 .

(2.23)
and the denominator is given by the integrated expression for v1 {2}, eq. (2.19). Similar
expressions follow for v4 (pT ) and v5 (pT ).
Finally, let us place some older measurements and calculations of v4 (pT ) into context
[22–28]. Traditionally, what was referred to as v4 (pT ) would today be called v4 (pT ) in the
Ψ2 plane:
hhv4 (pT )v2 cos(4Ψ4 (pT ) − 2Ψ2 − 2Ψ2 )ii

v4(22) (pT ){2} ≡

As discussed in the conclusions, the differences between v4(22) (pT ){2} and v4 (pT ){2} can be
used to partially disentangle the linear and non-linear response.

Summary

The goal of the present work is to compute the linear and non-linear response coefficients,
and to use these coefficients together with an initial Glauber model to determine hhvn2 ii with
Eqs. (2.16),(2.18), and (2.19). For v5 the step by step procedure is: (i) use hydrodynamics
to determine the response coefficients

and

(2.25)

2 3
for vanishingly small C5 and 2 3 ; (ii) use a Glauber model to determine the geometric coefficients that are needed in eq. (2.18), hhC52 ii, hh(2 3 )2 ii, and hhC5 2 3 cos(5Φ5 − 3Φ3 − 2Φ2 )ii;
(iii) combine these results in eq. (2.18) to determine the complete hydrodynamic prediction
for hhv52 ii. The necessary Glauber correlations are determined using the Phobos Monte Carlo
Glauber Model [29], and we note that there is a very strong geometric correlation between
participant planes differing by two, e.g.
C5 2 3 ei(5Φ5 −3Φ3 −2Φ2 )

,

and

1 2 3 ei(3Φ3 −Φ1 −2Φ2 )

.

(2.26)

This geometric correlation can be studied analytically in an independent source model [30],
and is easily attributed to the elliptic shape of the overlap region [9, 30, 31].

HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATIONS
Ideal and viscous hydrodynamics

To calculate the non-linear response we use a hydrodynamics code that implements conformal second order hydrodynamics [32]. The numerical scheme is based on a central scheme
developed and tested in Ref. [33], although the equations of motion for the π ij are somewhat different from what was studied in that work3 . η/s is held constant, and the ratio of second order hydro parameters are taken from their AdS/CFT values [32, 34], e.g.
τπ /(η/sT ) = 4 − 2 ln 2. The equation of state partially parametrizes lattice results and
was used previously by Romatschke and Luzum [35]. Finally, we have followed the time
“honored” constant temperature freezeout prescription, with Tfo = 150 MeV. For simplicity
we have adopted the popular quadratic ansatz for the viscous correction to the thermal
distribution function [2]
f (P ) = fo (P ) + δf (P ) ,

δf (P ) ≡

fo (1 ± fo ) µ ν
P P πµν ,
2(e + P)T 2

(3.1)

where fo (P ) = 1/(exp(−P · U (X)/T ) ∓ 1) is the equilibrium distribution, e + P is the
enthalpy, and δf is the first viscous correction [2, 36]. Although we have used the quadratic
ansatz in this work, a linear ansatz is probably more appropriate for QCD-like theories and
can effect the integrated flow for the higher harmonics [25, 37].
3

However, when additional non-conformal second order gradients are added to our equations of motion
and the parameters are matched, our current numerical can be compared directly to Ref. [33]. If this is
done, the two hydro-codes yield the same answers to 0.1% for the type of problems considered in this
work.

7

For the simulations shown below we have followed the centrality classification given in
Ref. [13] which is documented in Table I. of that work. Our procedure to determine the
response coefficient at a given impact parameter largely follows Ref. [9], which should be
referred to for additional details – see especially Appendix A of that work. Briefly, for each
impact parameter we determine the average squared radius hr2 i, and initialize a Gaussian
distribution that is deformed by the appropriate cumulant. The Gaussian is normalized to
reproduce the total entropy in the event. For instance, to determine the w5(23) we initialize
the distribution given in eq. (2.12) with 2 = 3 = 0.02. A technical complication is that the
distribution in eq. (2.12) must be regulated [9], and the regularization procedure introduces a
small C5 . However, the spurious C5 decreases faster than 3 and can be made arbitrarily small
compared to the signal. Empirically we find that the spurious C5 decreases approximately
as 5 , and the v5 from the spurious cumulant is negligibly small compared to the v5 from
the 2 3 combination.

B.

The non-linear response coefficients in ideal and viscous hydrodynamics

In this section we will study the non-linear response coefficients systematically. In particular we study how the linear and non-linear response coefficients depend (i) transverse
momentum, (ii) centrality, and (iii) shear viscosity.

1.

Momentum dependence of the response coefficients

Fig. 1 examines the pT dependence of the linear and non-linear response coefficients, w4
and w4(22) , which are characteristic of the response coefficients more generally. First, focus
on the ideal curves in Fig. 1(a) and (b). At large pT the non-linear response curves show a
characteristic quadratic rise with pT , while the linear response curves show a characteristic
linear rise. This difference between the non-linear and linear response is known from previous
studies of v4 [23]. Later, when examining non-linear corrections to v1 (see Fig. 6), we will see
that the non-linear corrections are most important at high pT and exhibit a characteristic
quadratic rise. Comparing Fig. 1(a) and (b), we see that viscous corrections are smaller
for the non-linear response w4(22) (pT )/22 , than for the linear response w4 (pT )/C4 . This is a
generic result as will be discussed in detail in Section III B 3.
We also note that the linear response curves shown in Fig. 1(a) change sign for sufficiently
large viscosity. This is an artifact of the first viscous correction, δf , and the quadratic ansatz.
To see this, we have plotted w4 (pT ) and and w4(22) (pT ) using only the unmodified distribution
function fo in Fig. 1(a) and (b). For large viscosity the δf correction to v4 and v5 is not small
compared to the ideal contribution fo , and this causes a reduction of the response, which
is more pronounced for the higher harmonics, v4 and v5 . In full kinetic theory calculations
w4 /C4 and w5 /C5 remain positive and approach zero as the viscosity is increased [12]. Thus,
the negative w4 /C4 indicates that the first viscous correction has become too large to be
trusted. Below, we will simply set the response coefficients to zero when this is the case.
Experience with kinetic theory suggests that this ad hoc procedure is not far from what
really happens.

for ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. The grey curves (which are shown only for η/s = 1/4π) exhibit the resulting response when the equilibrium distribution fo is used, and the viscous correction,
δf , is neglected (see eq. (3.1)).

2.

Centrality dependence of the response coefficients

Fig. 2 shows the linear and non-linear response coefficients in ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. There are several salient features contained in these plots. First, note that the
magnitude of the linear response coefficient w5 /C5 is quite small in the viscous case, and
w5 /C5 has been multiplied by ten to make the curves visible. The non-linear response w5(23)
coefficient is significantly larger. The implications of this difference will be studied in the
next section when we multiply the response coefficients by C5 and 2 3 respectively. Second,
all of the response coefficients are reduced by viscosity, especially in non-central collisions.
The viscous w4 /C4 and w5 /C5 curves stop abruptly as a function of centrality, since we
have truncated the curves when response falls below zero. As discussed above (see Fig. 1),
this is because viscous corrections to the thermal distribution function (δf ) become larger for
more peripheral collisions, and this correction is magnified by the high harmonic number. We
have therefore truncated the w4 and w5 response curves when the response turns negative.
At this point δf constitutes an order one correction and can no longer be trusted.

3.

Dependence on viscosity

It is interesting to note that viscous reduction for w1 /1 is smaller than for w4 /C4 and
w5 /C5 . This pattern of viscous corrections for linearized perturbations is studied further
in Fig. 3(a). Each linearized perturbation labeled by n, m-th cumulant is damped by a
factor ∼ exp(−Γn,m τfinal ) relative to ideal hydrodynamics, where τfinal is an estimate for the

the damping rate Γ5(23) is expected to scale as

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Results

Having clarified the non-linear hydrodynamic response, we study the phenomenological
implications of these response coefficients. Fig. 4 shows v1 , v4 and v5 including the linear
and non-linear response as outlined in Section II, and is the principal result of this work.
Examining this figures we see that the non-linear response is an important correction
for v1 , and essential for v4 and v5 . The contribution of the non-linear response to the
total flow increases towards peripheral collisions, and for v4 and v5 is of order 50% in midperipheral collisions. This is roughly compatible with simulation results from event-by-event
hydrodynamics [13, 14]. Especially for viscous hydrodynamics and for v5 , the linear response
is negligible in all but the most central bin. Even in the most central bin, the non-linear
contribution to v5 is about 50% of the total. It is notable, if expected, that for v1 viscosity
reduces the non-linear contribution relative to the total, while for v4 and v5 viscosity increases
the non-linear contributions. This is consistent with the discussion given in Section II B.
It will be quite interesting to measure the complete set of event planes (Ψ1 , Ψ2 , Ψ3 , Ψ4 , Ψ5 )
and their inter-correlations. These measurements will place a strong experimental constraint
on the relative of importance of the non-linear response [11]. For example, if the non-linear
response is dominant (as implied by the viscous v5 curves), then a stronger than geometric
correlation is expected for certain experimental averages, e.g. hcos(5Ψ5 − 3Ψ3 − 2Ψ2 )i.
Next we examine the pT dependence of the v1 ,v4 and v5 . Since v4 and v5 are dominated
by the non-linear response we will present our results by scaling v22 and v2 v3 respectively.
Many of the points raised in this and the next paragraph are familiar from earlier studies
of v4 in the Ψ2 plane. In particular, the importance of non-linearities and fluctuations in
determining the experimental v4 /v22 ratio was understood previously [23, 24].
First we note that according to an old argument by Borghini and Ollitrault [23], v4 /v22
should approach 1/2 at large momentum in ideal hydrodynamics for any given event due to
the non-linearities inherent in the phase space distribution. Their result is easily generalized
to v5 , v5 = v2 v3 . The argument follows by computing the freezeout distribution in a saddle
point approximation [39], and can be schematically understood by examining the thermal
factor in an approximately radially symmetric flow profile. The transverse flow vector as a
function of the spatial azimuthal angle φ relative to the reaction plane is
~uT = (ux , uy ) ' (uT (φ) cos φ, uT (φ) sin φ) ,

(4.1)

where in the second step we have assumed that the flow is approximately radially symmetric.
The transverse flow velocity is then expanded in harmonics

The leading exponential strongly correlates coordinate space angle φ and the momentum
space angle φp . In the second line we have anticipated the saddle point approximation,
(which realizes this correlation) and set φ ' φp in the post-exponent. The second term in
square brackets determines the linear response coefficient w2 and rises linearly with momen(2)
tum, w2 ∼ pT uT /T . The third term determines the non-linear response coefficient w4(22) ,
(2)
and grows quadratically with momentum, w4(22) ∼ 21 (pT uT /T )2 . At high pT this quadratic
(4)
growth overwhelms the (neglected) linear response due to uT , and leads to the characteristic
relation v4 = 21 v22 . An entirely identical argument shows that v5 = v2 v3 at high momentum
in ideal hydrodynamics.
The Borghini-Ollitrault argument given above shows that the response coefficients in
ideal hydro should asymptote at large momentum,

lines) approach the non-linear expectation of Borghini and Ollitrault (the dashed line) only
very slowly. This is in large part because w4 (pT ) is only qualitatively linear at sub-asymptotic
pT and increases almost quadratically at intermediate pT ∼ 1.5 GeV, momentarily keeping
up with the non-linear response. When viscous corrections are included, the non-linear
results become dominant in peripheral collisions. Similar results for v5 in ideal and viscous
hydrodynamics are also shown in Fig. 5. In the viscous case, the non-linear result gives
almost the full v5 {2} for all centrality classes shown.
It is worth noting that the magnitude of the viscous corrections as a function of pT for
v4 and v5 are sensitive to ansatz used for the viscous distribution function, δf [26]. In
particular, the quadratic ansatz used in this work assumes that the quasi-particle energy
loss is independent of momentum, dp/dt ∝ const. A linear ansatz for δf is better motivated
for QCD like theories and results in smaller viscous corrections for v4 and v5 as a function
of pT [37]. A complete discussion of this point is reserved for future work.

the non-linear response to 2 3 , and the total response, eq. (2.23).

Fig. 6 presents the corresponding analysis for v1 (pT ). We see that the non-linear terms
provide a correction to the linear response which grows with pT due to the quadratic dependence of the non-linear response coefficients, w1(23) ∝ p2T . We note that the viscous
corrections are approximately the same for v1 (pT ) and v2 (pT ), as expected from the discussion of viscous corrections given in Section II B.

Discussion

We have presented a framework of non-linear response to understand the higher harmonics
generated in heavy ion collisions. Then we extracted the non-linear response coefficients
using ideal and viscous hydrodynamics and studied the dependence on the shear viscosity,
in Fig. 2. The pattern of viscous corrections is further analyzed in Fig. 3 and explained
in Section III B. Generally, when the harmonic order is large, the non-linear response is
less damped than the corresponding linear response. Thus, when viscosity is included in
hydrodynamic simulations, the non-linear response becomes increasingly important for the
higher harmonics. This qualitative reasoning is confirmed in Fig. 4 which shows v1 , v4 and
v5 using linear and non-linear response and is the principal result of this work. We see that
the non-linear response is essential for v4 and v5 , and constitutes an important correction
for v1 .
Experimentally, the relative contributions of the linear and non-linear response can be
disentangled by measuring v5 in the 2Ψ2 + 3Ψ3 and Ψ5 planes, i.e. by measuring
v5(23) ≡ hcos(5φp − 2Ψ2 − 3Ψ3 )i ,

and v5(5) ≡ hcos 5(φp − Ψ5 )i .

(4.8)

Although a full discussion of this and similar measurements is reserved for future work,
a qualitative expectation based on Fig. 4(e) and (f) is that the hcos(5Ψ5 − 3Ψ3 − 2Ψ2 )i
correlation should be strong compared to the geometric average, and should change rapidly
16

from central to mid-central collisions. Qualitatively, this is precisely what was observed
recently by the ATLAS collaboration [11].
The non-linear response can also be studied by analyzing the pT dependence of the flow
harmonics. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 exhibit v4 (pT ), v5 (pT ), and v1 (pT ). In ideal hydrodynamics at
large pT we expect to find v4 = 12 v22 on an event by event basis. Our non-linear response
coefficients corroborate this non-linear expectation for v4 and an analogous relation for v5 ,
v5 = v2 v3 . However, since what is normally measured is v4 {2}/(v2 {2})2 and not hhv4 /v22 ii,
2
this ideal non-linear expectation must be multiplied by (h42 i / h22 i )1/2 when comparing to
the experimental data [24]. In addition, this expectation of ideal hydrodynamics is broken
by viscous corrections, and by the linear response to the fourth order cumulant C4 (i.e. 4 ).
When all of these corrections are taken into account, we find that relations such as v4 = 12 v22
and v5 = v2 v3 provide only a rough guide to the full result.
Throughout we have assumed perfect correlation between Ψ2 and Φ2 and Ψ3 and Φ3 .
This strict correlation is only approximately true. For instance the combination of a v1 and
a v3 can yield a v2 ,
v2 e−i2Ψ2 = w2 e−i2Φ2 + w2(13) e−i3Φ3 +iΦ1 .
(4.9)
This naturally provides a correlation between the Ψ2 and Ψ3 plane, although the geometric
correlation between Φ2 and Φ3 is negligibly small. Indeed the (Ψ2 , Ψ3 ) correlation, which was
very recently observed by the ATLAS collaboration [11], is too large to be easily explained
with the geometric correlations of the Glauber model. Similarly, assuming that the linear
response to 6 is negligible, one could expect that in central collisions v6 is determined by the
quadratic response to v3 , while in peripheral collisions v6 is determined by a cubic response
to v2
v6 e−i6Ψ6 = w6(222) e−i6Φ2 + w6(33) e−i6Φ3 .
(4.10)
Qualitatively, this pattern is consistent with the observed (Ψ6 , Ψ3 ) and (Ψ6 , Ψ2 ) correlations
presented in [11]. It will be interesting to see if all of the observed correlations can be
quantitatively understood with the non-linear response theory outlined in this paper. A full
quantitative comparison with the experimental data is reserved for future work.
