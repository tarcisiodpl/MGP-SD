Qualitative probabilistic networks have been
introduced as qualitative abstractions of
Bayesian belief networks. One of the ma­
jor drawbacks of these qualitative networks
is their coarse level of detail, which may lead
to unresolved trade-offs during inference. We
present an enhanced formalism for qualita­
tive networks with a finer level of detail.
An enhanced qualitative probabilistic net­
work differs from a regular qualitative net­
work in that it distinguishes between strong
and weak influences. Enhanced qualitative
probabilistic networks are purely qualitative
in nature, as regular qualitative networks are,
yet allow for efficiently resolving trade-offs
during inference.

INTRODUCTION

The formalism of Bayesian belief networks is generally
considered an intuitively appealing and powerful for­
malism for capturing complex problem domains along
with their uncertainties. The usually large number
of probabilities required for a belief network, how­
ever, tends to pose a major obstacle to their applica­
tion. To mitigate this obstacle, qualitative probabilis­
tic networks have been introduced as qualitative ab­
stractions of Bayesian belief networks [Wellman, 1990].
Like a Bayesian belief network, a qualitative proba­
bilistic network encodes variables and the probabilis­
tic interrelationships among these variables in a di­
rected graph; the relationships are not quantified by
conditional probabilities as in a belief network, but are
summarised by qualitative signs instead. For inference
with a qualitative probabilistic network, an elegant al­
gorithm is available, based on the idea of propagating
signs [Druzdzel & Henrion, 1993].

One of the major drawbacks of qualitative probabilis­
tic networks is their coarse level of detail. As a conse­
quence of their high abstraction level, qualitative prob­
abilistic networks do not provide for modelling the
intricacies involved in weighing conflicting influences
and, hence, do not provide for resolving trade-offs. In­
ference with a qualitative probabilistic network for a
real-life domain of application, therefore, quite often
leads to ambiguous results.
Ambiguous results in inference can be averted by en­
hancing the formalism of qualitative probabilistic net­
works to provide for a finer level of detail. Roughly
speaking, the finer the level of detail, the more trade­
offs can be resolved during inference. The problem
of trade-off resolution within the framework of quali­
tative networks has been addressed before by others.
S. Parsons has introduced, for example, the concept of
categorical influences. A categorical influence is either
an influence that serves to increase a probability to 1
or an influence that decreases a probability to 0, re­
gardless of any other influences, and thereby resolves
any trade-off in which it is involved [Parsons, 1995].
C.-1. Liu and M.P. Wellman have designed two meth­
ods for resolving trade-offs based upon the idea of re­
verting to numerical probabilities whenever necessary
[Liu & Wellman, 1998]. While only some trade-offs
can be resolved by the use of categorical influences,
the methods of Liu and Wellman provide for resolving
any trade-off. Their methods, however, require a fully
specified, numerical belief network. We would like to
mention that various other approaches to dealing with
uncertainty in a qualitative way have been proposed in
the literature. These approaches are not tailored for
use within the framework of qualitative probabilistic
networks and therefore will not be reviewed here.
To provide for trade-off resolution without resorting to
numerical probabilistic information, we have designed
an intuitively appealing formalism of enhanced quali­
tative networks. An enhanced qualitative probabilis­
tic network differs from a regular qualitative network

560

in that it distinguishes between strong and weak in­
fluences. For inference, we have generalised the sign­
propagation algorithm for regular qualitative networks
to deal with the strong and weak influences of an en­
hanced qualitative network. Trade-off resolution dur­
ing inference is based on the idea that strong influences
dominate over conflicting weak influences.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we
provide some preliminaries from the field of qualita­
tive networks to introduce our notational conventions.
In Section 3, we present the formalism of enhanced
qualitative probabilistic networks. In Section 4, we
detail various properties of these enhanced networks,
thereby providing for a sign-propagation algorithm for
inference. The paper is rounded off with some conclu­
sions and directions for future research in Section 6.

PRELIMINARIES

Qualitative probabilistic networks have been intro­
duced as abstractions of Bayesian belief networks. Be­
fore addressing qualitative networks, we briefly review
their quantitative counterparts. A Bayesian belief net­
work is a concise representation of a joint probability
distribution on a set of statistical variables. It encodes,
in an acyclic directed graph, the variables concerned
along with their probabilistic interrelationships. Each
node in the digraph represents a variable; the prob­
abilistic relationships between the variables are cap­
tured in the digraph's set of arcs. Associated with
each variable is a set of conditional probability dis­
tributions describing the relationship of this variable
with its (immediate) predecessors in the digraph.
We introduce a small Bayesian belief network that will
serve as our running example throughout the paper.
Example 2.1 We consider the small belief network
shown in Figure 1. The network represents a fragment

of fictitious and incomplete medical knowledge, per­
taining to the effects of administering antibiotics on
a patient. Node A represents whether or not a pa­
tient takes antibiotics. Node T models whether or not
the patient has typhoid fever and node D represents
presence or absence of diarrhoea in the patient. Node

F, to conclude, describes whether or not the composi­
tion of the patient's bacterial flora has changed. Ty­
phoid fever and a change in the patient's bacterial flora
are modelled as the possible causes of diarrhoea. An­
tibiotics can cure typhoid fever by killing the bacteria
that cause the infection. However, antibiotics can also
change the composition of the patient's bacterial flora,
thereby increasing the risk of diarrhoea. D
Qualitative probabilistic networks bear a strong re­
semblance to their quantitative counterparts. A qual­
itative probabilistic network also comprises an acyclic
digraph modelling variables and probabilistic interre­
lationships among variables. Instead of conditional
probability distributions, however, a qualitative prob­
abilistic network associates with its digraph qualitative
influences and qualitative synergies [Wellman, 1990].
A qualitative influence between two nodes expresses
how the values of one node influence the probabilities
of the values of the other node. A positive qualita­
tive influence of node A on its (immediate) successor
B, denoted s+(A,B), expresses that observing higher
values for A makes higher values for B more likely,
regardless of any other direct influence on B, that is,
Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I iix) � 0
for any combination of values x for the set 7r(B) \ {A}
of (immediate) predecessors of B other than A. A
negative qualitative influence, denoted by s-, and a
zero qualitative influence, denoted by S0, are defined
analogously, replacing � in the above formula by ::;
and =, respectively. If the influence of node A on
node B is not monotonic or unknown, we say that it
is ambiguous, denoted S7 (A,B).
The set of influences of a qualitative probabilis­
tic network exhibits various convenient properties
[Wellman, 1990]. The property of symmetry guar­
antees that, if the network includes the influence
s+(A, B), then it also includes s+(B, A). The prop­
erty of tmnsitivity asserts that qualitative influences
along a trail, that specifies at most one incoming arc
for each node, combine into a single influence with the
®-operator from Figure 2. The property of compo­
sition asserts that multiple qualitative influences be­
tween two nodes along parallel chains combine into a
single influence with the $-operator.

Enhancing QPNs for Trade-off Resolution

From Figure 2, we have that combining parallel qual­
itative influences with the Ell-operator may yield an
ambiguous result. Such an ambiguity, in fact, results
whenever influences with opposite signs are combined.
We say that the trade-off that is reflected by the con­
flicting influences cannot be resolved. Note that, in
contrast with the Ell-operator, the ®-operator cannot
introduce ambiguities upon combining signs of influ­
ences along trails.

bilities of the original belief network, in real-life appli­
cations, these relationships are elicited directly from
domain experts.
For reasoning with a qualitative probabilistic network,
an elegant algorithm is available from M.J. Druzdzel
and M. Henrion (1993); this algorithm is summarised
in pseudocode in Figure 4. The basic idea of the algoprocedure

Propagate-Sign(from, to, message):
sign[ to] +--- sign[to] Ell message;
for each (induced) neighbour V; of to
do linksign +--- sign of (induced) influence
between to and V;;
message +--- sign[to] ® linksign;
if V; f. from and V; ¢. Observed
and sign[V;] f. sign[V;] Ell message
then Propagate-Sign(to, V;, message)

In addition to influences, a qualitative probabilistic
network includes synergies, that express how the value
of one node influences the probabilities of the values
of another node in view of a given value for a third
node [Henrion & Druzdzel, 1991]. A negative product
synergy of node A on node B (and vice versa) given
the value c for their common successor C, denoted
x-({A,B},c), expresses that, given c, higher values
for A render higher values for B less likely, that is,
Pr(c I abx)- Pr(c I abx)- Pr(c I abx)- Pr(c I abx) :S 0
for any combination of values x for the set 71' ( C) \
{A,B} of predecessors of C other than A and B. A
product synergy induces a qualitative influence be­
tween the predecessors of a node upon observation;
the induced influence is coined an intercausal influ­
ence. Positive, zero, and ambiguous product synergies
again are defined analogously.
Example 2.2 We consider the qualitative abstraction
of the Antibiotics belief network from Figure 1. From
the conditional probability distributions specified for
node T, we have that
Pr(t I a)

-

Pr(t I a) :S 0

and therefore that s-(A,T); we further find that
s+(A,F ), s+(T,D), and s+(F,D). Either value for
node D, in addition, induces a negative intercausal
influence between the nodes T and F. The result­
ing qualitative probabilistic network is shown in Fig­
ure 3. D

Figure 3: The Qualitative Antibiotics Network.

We would like to note that, although in the previous
example,we have computed the qualitative probabilis­
tic relationships among the variables from the proba-

rithm is to trace the effect of observing a node's value
on the other nodes in the network by message-passing
between neighbouring nodes. For each node, a sign is
determined, indicating the direction of change in the
node's probabilities occasioned by the new observation
given all previously observed node values. Initially, all
node signs equal '0'. For the newly observed node, an
appropriate sign is entered, that is, either a '+' for
the observed value true or a '-' for the value false.
The node updates its sign and subsequently sends a
message to each neighbour and every node on which
it exerts an induced intercausal influence. The sign of
this message is the ®-product of the node's (new) sign
and the sign of the influence it traverses. This process
is repeated throughout the network, building on the
properties of symmetry, transitivity, and composition
of influences.

THE ENHANCED FORMALISM

Qualitative probabilistic networks model a problem
domain at a coarse level of detail. This coarseness
of representation is most visible in the way relation­
ships among variables are captured: the relationships
are summarised by qualitative influences without any
indication of their strengths. As a consequence of the
coarse level of detail, any trade-off encountered dur­
ing inference will remain unresolved. To allow for re­
solving trade-offs in a qualitative way, we enhance the
formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks by as­
sociating a relative strength with influences. If in a
trade-off, for example, the positive influence is known
to be stronger than the conflicting negative one, we
may then conclude the combined influence to be posi­
tive, thereby resolving the trade-off.

562

Renooij and van der Gaag

In our formalism of enhanced qualitative probabilistic
networks, we distinguish between strong and weak in­
fluences. We begin by focusing on the strong and weak
positive influences. The basic idea is to partition the
set of all positive influences into two disjoint sets of in­
fluences in such a way that any influence from the one
subset is stronger than any influence from the other
subset. To this end, a cut-off value 6 is introduced.
This value serves to partition the set of qualitative
influences into a set of influences that capture a differ­
ence in probabilities larger than 6 and a set of influ­
ences that model a difference smaller than 6. An influ­
ence from the former subset will be termed a strongly
positive influence; an influence from the latter subset
will be termed a weakly positive influence.
More formally, a strongly positive qualitative influence
of a node A on its successor B, denoted s++(A,B),
expresses, first and foremost, that observing higher
values for A makes higher values for B more likely,
regardless of any other influence on B; in addition, it
expresses that
Pr(b I ax)

-

Upon abstracting a Bayesian belief network to an en­
hanced qualitative probabilistic network, the cut-off
value 6 needs to be chosen explicitly. This cut-off
value will typically vary from application to applica­
tion. Note that it is always possible to choose a cut-off
value, as the value 6 = 1 yields a trivial partitioning
of the set of influences.
Example 3.1 We consider once again the Antibiotics
belief network from Example 2.1. Suppose that we
choose for our cut-off value 6 = 0.30. For the influence
of node A on node T, we now find that
Pr(t I a) - Pr(t I a) � 0, and
I Pr(t I a) - Pr(t I a) I = 0.34;::: 6
We therefore conclude that s--(A, T). We further
find that s++(T, D), s+(A, F), and s+(F, D). The
resulting enhanced qualitative probabilistic network is
shown in Figure 5. 0

Pr(b I ax) ;::: 6

for any combination of values x for the set 1r( B) \ {A}
of predecessors of B other than A, where 6 is the cut­
off value used. A weakly positive qualitative influence
of A on B, denoted s+(A, B), is a positive qualitative
influence such that
Pr(b I

ax

)

-

Figure 5: The Enhanced Antibiotics Network.

Pr(b I ax) � 6

for any combination of values x for the set 1r(B) \ {A}
of predecessors of B other than A, where 6 once again
is the cut-off value used. Strongly negative qualitative
influences, denoted s--' and weakly negative qualita­
tive influences, denoted s-' are defined analogously;
zero qualitative influences and ambiguous qualitative
influences are defined as in regular qualitative proba­
bilistic networks. In the sequel, we will use the phrase
strong influences to refer to both strongly positive and
strongly negative influences; the phrase weak influ­
ences is meant to have an analogous meaning. We
further say that a product synergy is strongly negative
if it induces a strongly negative intercausal influence.
Strongly positive product synergies are defined analo­
gously; zero product synergies and ambiguous product
synergies again are defined as in regular qualitative
networks.
We would like to note that, in our enhanced formal­
ism, the meaning of the sign of an influence has slightly
changed. W hile in a regular qualitative probabilistic
network, the sign of an influence represents the sign of
a difference in probabilities only, in an enhanced qual­
itative network a sign in addition captures the relative
magnitude of the difference.

We would like to note that, in real-life applications of
enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks, a cut-off
value need not be established explicitly. The parti­
tioning into strong and weak influences then is elicited
directly from the domain experts involved in the con­
struction of the network.

INFERENCE WITH AN
ENHANCED NETWORK

For inference with a regular qualitative probabilistic
network, an elegant algorithm is available. We recall
from Section 2 that this algorithm builds on the idea
of propagating signs throughout a network and com­
bining them with the 0- and Ell-operators. We fur­
ther recall that the algorithm exploits the properties
of symmetry, transitivity, and parallel composition of
influences. To generalise the idea of sign-propagation
to inference with an enhanced qualitative probabilis­
tic network, we enhance, in the Sections 4.1 and 4.2,
the 0- and Ell-operators to provide for the properties
of transitivity and parallel combination of strong and
weak influences; in Section 4.3, we address the prop­
erty of symmetry.

Enhancing QPNs for Trade-off Resolution

4.1

ENHANCING THE 0-0PERATOR

For propagating qualitative signs along trails of nodes
in an enhanced qualitative probabilistic network, we
enhance the 0-operator that is defined for regular
qualitative networks, to apply to strong and weak in­
fluences. We recall that the 0-operator basically pro­
vides for multiplying signs of influences. In a regular
qualitative probabilistic network, an influence captures
a difference between two probabilities. Upon multiply­
ing the signs of two influences, therefore, the sign of
the result of the multiplication of two such differences
is computed. In our formalism of enhanced qualitative
probabilistic networks, we have added an explicit no­
tion of relative magnitude to influences. It will be ev­
ident that these relative magnitudes need to be taken
into consideration when multiplying signs.
To address the effect of multiplying two signs in an en­
hanced qualitative probabilistic network, we consider
the network fragment shown in Figure 6. The frag-

ment includes the trail of nodes A, B, C, with two
qualitative influences between them; in addition, X
denotes the set of all predecessors of B other than A,
and Y is the set of all predecessors of C other than B.
For the qualitative influence of A on C,we have that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) =
(Pr(c I by)- Pr(c I by))· (Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I ax))
for any combination of values x for the set of nodes X
and any combination of values y for the set Y.
Suppose that both qualitative influences in the net­
work fragment under consideration are strongly posi­
tive, that is, we have that s++(A, B) and s++(B, C);
suppose that we have used the cut-off value 8 for dis­
tinguishing between strong and weak influences. From
the expression stated above for the influence of node
A on node C, we now find that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) � ()2
for any combination of values xy for the set of nodes
XU Y. Since 8 ::; 1, we have that 82 :S 8. Upon mul­
tiplying the signs of two strong influences, therefore,

563

a sign results that expresses an influence that may or
may not be stronger than a single weakly positive in­
fluence.
Now suppose that both qualitative influences in the
network fragment from Figure 6 are weakly positive,
that is, we have that s+(A, B) and s+(B, C). For the
influence of node A on node C, we now find that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) :S (j2
for any combination of values xy for the set X U Y.
While the influence resulting from the multiplication
of two strong influences cannot be compared to a sin­
gle weak influence, the above observation shows that
the resulting influence will always be at least as strong
as an influence resulting from the multiplication of two
weak influences. To provide for comparing qualitative
influences along different trails with respect to their
magnitude, as required for trade-off resolution, there­
fore, we need to retain the length of the trail in the
network over which influences have been multiplied.
To provide for comparing qualitative influences along
different trails, we augment every influence's sign by
a superscript, called the sign's multiplication index. A
strongly positive qualitative influence with multiplica­
tion index i of node A on node B, written s++' (A, B),
is now taken to denote that
Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I ax) � 8i
for every combination of values x for the set X of pre­
decessors of B other than A. A weakly positive quali­
tative influence with multiplication index i of A on B,
written s+; (A, B), is taken to indicate that
0 :s Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I ax) :s 8i
for every combination of values x for the set X. The
signs associated with the arcs of the digraph are inter­
preted as having a multiplication index equal to 1.
Building on the concept of multiplication index, Fig­
ure 7 shows the table for the enhanced 0-operator.
From the table, it is readily seen that the +, -, 0, and
? signs combine as in a regular qualitative probabilistic
network; the difference is just in the handling of the
multiplication indices. In the table, there appear signs
+? and -7; we will elaborate on the meaning of these
signs in Section 4.2.
We like to further comment on the combination of the
signs +; and ++i. In doing so, we consider once again
the network fragment from Figure 6. Suppose that we
have s+" (A, B) for the influence of node A on node
B, and s++; (B, C) for the influence of B on C. The
weakly positive influence of A on B expresses that
Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I ax) :s 8i

decessors of B other than A. The strongly positive
qualitative influence of B on C further expresses that
Pr(c I by)- Pr(c I by) 2 8i

decessors of C other than B. For the influence of A
on C, we now find that

various qualitative influences; in addition, X denotes
the set of all predecessors of B other than A, and Y
is the set of all predecessors of C other than A and B.
For the net qualitative influence of node A on node C
along the two parallel trails, we have that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) =
(Pr(c I aby)- Pr(c I aby)) Pr(b I ax)+
-(Pr(c I aby)- Pr(c I aby)) Pr(b I ax)+

ENHANCING THE EB-OPERATOR

For combining multiple qualitative influences between
two nodes along parallel trails in an enhanced quali­
tative network, we enhance the EB-operator that is de­
fined for regular qualitative probabilistic networks, to
apply to strong and weak influences. We recall that the
EB-operator basically provides for adding signs of influ­
ences. We further recall that, upon adding the signs of
two conflicting influences in a regular qualitative net­
work, the represented trade-off cannot be resolved and
an ambiguous influence results. In our formalism of
enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks, we have
added an explicit notion of relative magnitude to in­
fluences. These relative magnitudes can now be taken
into consideration when adding the signs of conflict­
ing influences and used to resolve trade-offs, thereby
forestalling ambiguous results.
When addressing the enhanced ®-operator, in the pre­
vious section, we have argued that the multiplication
of two influences yields an influence of possibly smaller
magnitude. We will now see that the addition of two
influences, in contrast, may result in an influence of
larger magnitude. To address the effect of adding two
signs in an enhanced qualitative probabilistic network,
we consider the network fragment shown in Figure 8.
The fragment includes the parallel trails A, C, and A,

Figure 8: Another Network Fragment.
Suppose that all qualitative influences in the network
fragment under consideration are weakly positive, that
is, we have that s+(A, B), s+(B, C), and s+(A, C);
suppose that we have used the cut-off value 8 for dis­
tinguishing between strong and weak influences. The
net influence of node A on node C equals the sum of
the influence with sign +1 along the trail A, C, and
the influence with sign +2 along the trail A, B, C.
From the expression stated above for the net influence
of A on C, we find that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) 2 0
The minimum of this difference is attained, for exam­
ple, for Pr(c I aby) = 0, which enforces Pr(c I aby) = 0,
and Pr(b I ax) = Pr(b I ax) = 0. We further find that
Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) � 8 + 82

This maximum is attained, for example, for Pr(c I
aby) = 1, Pr(c I aby) = 1- 8, Pr(c I aby) = 1- 2 · 8,
Pr(c I aby) = 1- 8, and Pr(b I ax) = 1. In computing
the maximum of the difference,we have used explicitly
the information that all influences are weakly positive.
From the maximum attained, it is readily seen that
the addition of two weakly positive influences yields a
result that may or may not be stronger than a weakly
positive influence. In general,we have that the result
of adding two positive or two negative influences is at
least as strong as the strongest of the influences added.
From the preceding observations, we have that the
qualitative influence that results from adding two
weakly positive influences,is either weakly positive or
strongly positive. So,although the resulting influence
is known to be positive, its relative magnitude is un­
known. To capture this ambiguity,we use +? to denote
the influence's sign. An ambiguously positive qualita­
tive influence of node A on node C,written s+'(A, C),
is therefore taken to indicate that
0::::; Pr(c I axy)- Pr(c I axy) ::::;

1

for any combination of values xy for the set X U Y.
Similarly, -7 is used to denote an ambiguously nega­
tive qualitative influence.
The enhanced EB-operator is shown in Figure 9. From
the table, it is readily seen that the +, -, 0, and ?
signs combine as in a regular qualitative probabilistic
network; the difference is just in the handling of the
multiplication indices and the ambiguity subscripts.
We like to further comment on the resolution of trade­
offs using the enhanced EB-operator. In doing so, we
consider once again the network fragment from Fig­
ure 8. Suppose that we have s++(A, C) for the direct
influence of node A on node C, and that we further
have s+( A,B) and s-(B,C). The net influence of
node A on node C equals the sum of the influence with
sign ++1 along the trail A, C,and the influence with
sign -2 along the trail A, B, C. From the expression
for the net influence of A on C,we find that
Pr(c I axy) - Pr(c I axy) � 8- 82

The minimum for the difference is attained, for ex­
ample, for Pr(c I aby) = 2 8, Pr(c I aby) = 8,
Pr(c I aby) = 8,Pr(c I aby) = 0,and Pr(b I ax)- Pr(b I
ax)= 6. In computing the minimum of the difference,
we have once again exploited the information with re­
gard to the signs and relative magnitudes of the in­
fluences involved. From the minimum attained, it is
readily seen that the net influence of node A on node
C is positive. However,as 8 -82 < 8,the net influence
may either be strong or weak. We conclude that the
net influence of A on C is ambiguously positive. So,
+ +1 EB-2 = +7. Similar observations apply to various
other trade-offs.

THE PROPERTY OF SYMME TRY

The sign-propagation algorithm for inference with a
regular qualitative network explicitly builds on the
properties of symmetry,transitivity,and parallel com­
position of influences. We have so far addressed the
0- and E&-operators and have thereby guaranteed the
transitivity and parallel-composition properties of in­
fluences. We now focus on the property of symmetry
to enable the propagation of qualitative influences over
a single arc in the network in both directions.
In a regular qualitative probabilistic network, the
property of symmetry guarantees that, if a node A
exerts an influence on a node B, then node B exerts
an influence of the same sign on node A. In an en­
hanced qualitative network, an influence and its re­
verse also are both positive or both negative. The
symmetry property,however, does not hold with re­
gard to the relative magnitudes of an influence and its
reverse. The reverse of a strongly positive qualitative
influence may be a weakly positive influence, and vice
versa. As the relative magnitude of the reverse of a
positive influence is unknown, the reverse is taken to
be ambiguously positive. A similar observation applies
to the reverse of a negative influence.
To conclude, we would like to mention that an alter­
native way of ensuring that the property of symmetry
holds in an enhanced qualitative network is to spec-

ify the signs of all reversed influences explicitly; these
signs will then have to be elicited from the domain
experts involved in the network's construction.

TRADE-OFF RESOLUTION: AN
EXAMPLE

In the previous sections, we have argued that the
properties of symmetry, transitivity, and parallel com­
position of influences hold in an enhanced qualita­
tive probabilistic network. The sign-propagation algo­
rithm from Section 2 therefore is generalised straight­
forwardly to apply to enhanced qualitative networks:
instead of the regular®- and E&-operators, it just has to
use the enhanced operators for propagating and com­
bining influences. We illustrate the application of the
algorithm by means of our running example.
Example 4.5 We consider once again the qualitative
Antibiotics network from Figure 3. Suppose that we
enter the sign + for node A. Node A propagates this
sign towards node T. Node T thereupon receives the
sign + ®- = - and sends it to node D. Node D in
turn receives the sign -® + = - ; it does not pass on
any sign. Node A also sends its positive sign to node
F. Node F receives the sign + ® + = + and passes
it on to node D. Node D then receives the additional
sign +® + = +. The two signs that enter node D are
combined and result in the ambiguous sign - E& + =?
.

Now, consider the enhanced Antibiotics network from
Figure 4. We enter the sign ++0 for node A; this sign
reflects a positive observation for A. We once again
apply the sign-propagation algorithm, this time using
our enhanced operators. Recall that initially all influ­
ences' signs have a multiplication-index of 1. Node A
propagates its sign towards node T. Node T receives
the sign + +0 ® - -1 = --1 and sends it to node
D. Node D receives - -1 0 + +1 = --2. Node A
sends its sign ++0 also to node F. Node F there­
upon receives the sign + +0 ®+1 = +1 and passes it
on to node D. Node D receives the additional sign
+1 ® +1 = +2. Combining the two signs that enter
node D results in the sign - -2 E&+2 = -? · Note
that, while in the regular qualitative network the rep­
resented trade-off cannot be resolved and results in an
ambiguous influence, the trade-off is resolved in the
enhanced qualitative probabilistic network. 0

Conclusions and further research

One of the major drawbacks of qualitative probabilis­
tic networks is their coarse level of detail. Although
it may suffice for some problem domains, the coarse­
ness of detail may lead to unresolved trade-offs dur­
ing inference in other domains. To provide for re-

solving trade-offs, we have enhanced the formalism
of qualitative probabilistic networks by distinguish­
ing between strong and weak influences. We have
enhanced the multiplication and addition operators
to guarantee the transitivity and parallel-composition
properties of influences, thereby generalising the basic
sign-propagation algorithm to apply to enhanced qual­
itative networks. We have shown that our formalism
provides for resolving trade-offs in a qualitative, yet
efficient way.
Our formalism of enhanced qualitative probabilistic
networks does not provide for resolving all possible
trade-offs during inference. Since qualitative abstrac­
tions do not have the same expressiveness as numerical
belief networks, it is hardly likely that any qualitative
abstraction will be able to resolve all possible trade­
offs. We suspect, however, that in our enhanced signs
more information is hidden than we currently exploit
upon multiplying and adding influences. In the near
future, we will therefore investigate whether still more
trade-offs can be resolved within the framework of our
enhanced qualitative networks. In addition, we will
address the non-associativity of the addition-operator
for influences and design heuristics to forestall unnec­
essary ambiguous results. To conclude, we will extend
our formalism to incorporate non-binary variables.
