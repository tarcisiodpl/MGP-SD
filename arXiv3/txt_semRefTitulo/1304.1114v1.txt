Cutset conditioning and clique-tree
propagation are two popular methods for
performing exact probabilistic inference in
Bayesian belief networks. Cutset conditioning is
based on decomposition of a subset of network
nodes, whereas clique-tree propagation depends on
aggregation of nodes. We describe a means to
combine cutset conditioning and clique-tree
propagation in an approach called aggregation
after decomposition (AD). We discuss the
application of the AD method in the Pathfinder
system, a medical expert system that offers
assistance with diagnosis in hematopathology.

The Pathfinder expert system resulted from a
joint project by the University of Southern
California and Stanford University to assist
general pathologists with diagnosis in the
specialty area of hematopathology [Heckerman,
1985; Heckerman, 1989; Heckerman, 1990b].
Uncertain knowledge must be represented and
reasoned with in this system; therefore, the
Pathfinder researchers have explored a variety of
techniques for reasoning under uncertainty. After
early failures to represent complex uncertain
knowledge effectively with production rules and
with nonprobabilistic scoring schemes, the
Pathfinder team concentrated on decision­
theoretic methods for diagnosis [ Heckerman,
1990b]. Thus, the current representation of the
Pathfinder knowledge base includes a multiply
connected Bayesian belief network. In this belief
network, 63 malignant and benign diseases of
lymph nodes are represented by a single node, the
disease node,1 and over 100 morphologic and
nonmorphologic features (findings) visible in
lymph-node tissue are each represented by a
separate node (see Figure 1). The feature nodes
each have between two and ten mutually exclusive
and exhaustive values. The disease node has 63

1 In this paper, we shall use the term

diagnosis to
indicate a single value of the disease node.

values, each representing a possible diagnosis.
Thus, the underlying ass umption in this
representation is that diseases (but not features) in
hematopathology are mutually exclusive, and
that the set of possible diagnoses represented by
the disease node is exhaustive. The assumption in
Pathfinder that diseases in hematopathology are
mutually exclusive is appropriate, because co­
occurring diseases almost always appear in
different lymph nodes or in different regions of the
same lymph node, and a user can analyze each
area of pathology separately.
The inference problem in the Pathfinder
system is to calculate the marginal probability
distribution for the disease node, given that
various feature nodes have been instantiated to
observed values. Exact probabilistic inference in
Bayesian belief networks is NP-hard [Cooper,
1990]. Thus, it is quite unlikely that an algorithm
for probabilistic inference on belief networks can
ever be developed that is efficient even in the
worst cases.
Recently, we chose to approach the
Pathfinder inference problem with an algorithm
developed by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter
[Lauritzen, 1988], later refined by the MUNIN
team [Andersen, 1989]. We shall refer to this
algorithm as clique-tree propagation (CTP). T h e
underlying principle of CTP is aggregation of nodes
into clusters called cliques. Once the nodes have
been grouped into diques, the resulting structure is
a tree, in which probabilities are propagated by
local operations.
Within the clique tree, we
propagate evidence by first calculating the joint
probability of the nodes in each clique, and then
adjusting these joint probabilities to be consistent
with those of adjacent cliques in the clique tree
[ Andersen, 1989]. The computational time
complexity of CTP increases exponentially with
the number of nodes in each clique [Lauritzen, 1988,
pp. 186-188]: The complexity is proportional to the
state-space size of each clique, which is the
product of the numbers of possible values of the
nodes in that clique. Thus, if inference is to be
tractable, we must keep the cliques small.

AJthough the performance of the CTP
method for inference in Pathfinder was
satisfactory, we realized that we could improve

I

inference times by taking into account the special
structure of the Pathfinder belief network. The
disease node in the Pathfinder network is a
parent to all but two feature nodes in the network.
As a result, the disease node is in almost every
clique in the clique tree. Due to the large number
(63) of possible values of the disease node, the
average state-space size of the cliques is fairly
large. By treating the disease node as though it
is instantiated, we can remove it from the cliques,
simplifying
pro p a g a t i o n
of
evidence
considerably.
Simplifying
n etwork
structure
by
instantiating a node for which no evidence has
been observed was first described by Pearl [Pearl,
1986a]. He developed this method, called cutset
conditioning (CC), to enable the use of Kim and
Pearl's polytree algorithm [Kim, 1983; Pearl,

I
I
I
I
I
I

I
I

1986b] for inference in multiply connected belief
networks. One of the principal drawbacks of
Pearl's use of cutset conditioning is that we must
cut every loop in the network with an
instantiated node (a member of the loop cutset) to
use the polytree algorithm for inference
[Suermondt, (in press)]. During inference, we must
consider each possible combination of
instantiated values of the loop-cutset nodes; the
number of these loop-cutset instances is equal to
the product of the numbers of possible values of
the loop-cutset nodes, and this product is clearly
exponential in the number of loop-cutset nodes.

2. Aggregation After Decomposition

I

To use the polytree algorithm for inference in
a multiply connected belief network, we must cut
every loop in the network. If there are many

I

loops, this requirement leads quickly to a number
of loop-cutset instances that is so large that
inference becomes intractable. The solution to this
problem is to use the CTP method, rather than
the polytree algorithm, for inference in the
partially
decomposed
n etwork:
After
decomposing the loop-cutset nodes, we aggregate
the nodes of the revised network into cliques and
form a clique tree, which we use for inference.
Since CTP does not require that the network be
singly connected, we do not need to cut all the
loops in the network; rather, we make a loop

I
I
I
I
I

cutset of one or a few nodes to simplify the
structure of the clique tree. The desired result is

that the cliques in the revised network are
smaller than are those in the original network.
We call this approach aggregation after
decomposition (AD); we describe it in more detail
in [Suermondt, 1990; Beckerman, 1990a, Ch. 4]. In
the case of the Pathfinder network, we
decompose the disease node by acting as though
that node has been instantiated. The loop cutset
consists of only the disease node; each instance of
the loop cutset corresponds to a single diagnosis,
and the weight of each loop-cutset instance
[Pearl, 1986a; Pearl, 1988, p. 206; Suermondt,
1989] is equal to the marginal probability of the
corresponding diagnosis. After making the
disease node the loop cutset, we remove this node
from the network and aggregate the remaining
nodes to form a clique tree.
D ue to the structure of the Pathfinder
network, removal of the disease node disconnects
sections of the belief network from one another.
After we condition on the disease node, the
resulting clique tree is not connected. Rather, it
consists of several independent portions that can
be updated independently. This disconnected
clique tree speeds up inference in the case of the
Pathfinder network: During inference, we must
propagate evidence through only those portions
of the clique tree in which there is new evidence.
In the original-connected-clique tree, every
evidence observation was propagated to the
entire clique tree. As we shall discuss in Section 3,
disconnecting the clique tree is the primary
benefit of applying the AD method to the
Pathfinder belief network.
During inference using the AD method in
Pathfinder, we must consider separately each
possible diagnosis. Analogously to cutset
conditioning, we maintain a separate copy of the
network for each possible diagnosis d i. We

maintain a weight W i that reflects the current
marginal probability of diagnosis di. Initially,

Wi is equal to the prior marginal probability of
d i, which can be obtained directly from the
knowledge base: Wi = P(di).
When we observe evidence, we must update
the weights to obtain the posterior probability of
each diagnosis. Let us denote the new evidence by
E; E is a set of nodes, each with a single observed
value. The new weight for each diagnosis, Wi is

where a. is the normalization constant over all
diagnoses d;; that is, a.= 1/P(E).
Clearly, we must know P(E I di) to be able to
calculate w(. Fortunately, CTP provides us with
this probability in a straighforward manner.
During inference, we propagate the new evidence
through the clique tree for each possible
diagnosis. We must propagate evidence through
only those portions of the clique tree that contain
nodes for which new evidence has been observed.
We collect evidence into a single top clique for
each relevant disconnected portion of the
network. Normalizing the marginal probabilities
for the top clique of a network portion yields a
normal zation constant that is equal to the joint

probabthty of all the evidence that is newly
observed for that network portion [Lauritzen,
1988, p.185]. By multiplying these normalization
constants for all the independent network
portions that contain new evidence, we obtain
P(E I d i ). Thus, we can obtain the posterior

marginal probability of each diagnosis given the
observed evidence.

3. Results of Application of AD to Pathfinder
Removing the disease node from the network
results in a clique tree in which the cliques are
considerably smaller than are those in the
original network. Since the disease node has 63
possible values, and the disease node is a member
o virtually all cliques, the average state-space
s1ze decreases by a factor of approximately 63
when we remove the disease node. However, this
reduction is largely compensated for by the fact
that we have to consider separately each of the
possible 63 diagnoses. Thus, even though a single
evidence-propagation sweep through the
network is much less complex, when we observe
new evidence, we have to perform 63 of these
sweeps (using the AD method), rather than a
single one (using CTP). Thus, the net result-the
t otal inference time-may be virtually
unchanged: The reduction of the size of the
cliques alone does not lead to faster evidence
propagation.
Nonetheless, on average AD leads to faster
evidence propagation in the Pathfinder network.

�

Due to the special structure of the Pathfinder
belief network, instantiation of the disease node

yields a disconnected clique tree.2 In this
di connected clique tree, we need to propagate
eVtdence through only those portions of the clique
tree that contain nodes for which new evidence
has been observed. When there is evidence in
every disconnected portion, the inference time for
AD is about the same as for CTP. Usually,
however, evidence is present only in some
portions of the tree. In these cases, AD is faster
than CTP. In the best case, all evidence nodes
belong to a single small portion of the clique tree,
and all other portions can be left unchanged; in
the worst case, each portion of the clique tree
contains at least one evidence node, and the entire
clique tree must be updated. Notice that, even in
the worst case, the AD method is no slower than
isCTP.
Clearly, the degree to which inference in
Pathfinder is faster when we apply A D rather
than CTP depends strongly on the location of the
evidence nodes in typical Pathfinder cases. We
per ormed a preliminary evaluation of AD, in
whtch we selected 20 cases in sequence from a
large library of referrals. For each case, a
community pathologist reported salient

�

morphologic features to Pathfinder. The
pathologist entered features until she believed
that no additional observations were relevant to
the case.
The number of observed features in our test
cases averaged 5.7 (range 3-10; cr 2). We found
that the average run time using AD in the test
cases was 0.530 of the run time using CTP in
Pathfinder (range 0.098-0.921; cr = 0.389). Thus,
assumi g that the cases in our preliminary
evaluat10n represent typical Pathfinder cases,
we can expect that inference times using AD will
be approximately twice as fast, on average, as
those using CTP. However, the large standard
deviation cr indicates that the improvement in
inference time using AD rather than CTP varies
widely among the cases.
Strikingly, we found that the run times were
clearly clustered (see Figure 2). One cluster
contained 9 cases with 3 to 5 features each and
run times that averaged 0.112 of the full
run
time (range 0.098-0.169; cr = 0.024); the other
cluster had 11 cases with 4 to 10 features each and

Strictly speaking, the disconnected clique
structure is no longer a tree, but rather a forest. In
this paper, owever, we shall refer to the clique
structure-<hsconnected or not-as the clique tree.

run times that averaged 0.872 of full CTP run
time (range 0.822 - 0.921; CJ = 0.032). Thus,
depending on the case, AD performed inference
either an order of magnitude faster than did CTP,
or only marginally faster.
We can explain the clustering of case results
by considering the size of the portions into which
the clique tree is divided. Many of the
independent portions consist of a single node or a
pair of nodes; evidence in such portions can be
absorbed extremely rapidly. On the other hand,
the largest independent portion of the clique tree
contains 23 cliques and 29 feature nodes. All
cliques containing more than three nodes­
including one clique that contains six nodes-are
in this network portion. As mentioned in Section
1, the time complexity of evidence propagation
between cliques increases exponentially with the
number of nodes in each clique. Thus, the inference
time required to update the single network
portion containing all the largest cliques is
greater than that for all the remaining network
portions combined. If evidence is observed for any
features in that large network portion, inference
time using AD will not be much faster than that
for CTP. In Section 4, we discuss briefly the
possibility of breaking up such large network
portions.

4. Extensions and Discussion
Selection of an appropriate loop cutset is not
a problem in the Pathfinder network: The disease
node forms an obvious choice. Clearly, it is
possible to consider instantiation of additional
nodes as loop-cutset members [Suermondt, 1990;
Heckerman, 1990a]. Such an addition might yield
a clique tree that is disconnected even further,
allowing us to obtain more efficient evidence
propagation on average. Although there are
several nodes in the Pathfinder network that are
suitable loop-cutset candidates, there is an
important drawback associated with addition to
the loop cutset of nodes other than the disease
node. Our primary goal in Pathfinder is to obtain
the marginal probability of each diagnosis; if
the disease node is the only loop-cutset node,
these marginals are equal to the weights of the
diagnoses. If we add other nodes to the loop
cutset,
we
must
perform
a d d itional
marginalization operations to obtain the
marginal probabilities of the diagnoses after
absorption of evidence. Thus, when we add other
nodes to the loop cutset, inference using AD may
be slower-in the worst case-than inference
using CTI'.
The method of conditioning, regardless of the
manner in which evidence is absorbed, opens the

I
I

278

way for several modifications of the inference
scheme. One advantage of the conditioning
approach is that we can consider each of the
diagnoses
separately.
Thus,
evidence
propagation for the diagnoses can be performed in
parallel, after which we aggregate the results by
normalizing the weights. Such a parallel
implementation may lead to substantial savings
in inference time.
Another option made possible by the use of
conditioning in AD is bounded conditioning
[Horvitz, 1989]. In brief, bounded conditioning
allows us to speed up inference by removing from
consideration diagnoses with a very low
marginal probability. After eliminating these
diagnoses, we obtain exact bounds on the posterior
probabilities of the remaining diagnoses. The
reduction in inference time is related linearly to
the number of eliminated diagnoses, provided
that we can obtain the joint probability of the
new evidence at low computational cost. This
limits the applicability of the method to cases
where all new evidence is contained in a single
clique. A possible danger of applying bounded
conditioning is that we remove from consideration
the most probable diagnosis. Such a situation
could occur if this diagnosis, before instantiation
of the evidence nodes, has a very low prior
probability. Nonetheless, the wide bounds on the
posterior probabilities of the remaining
diagnoses will inform us of the situation.
We conclude from our experiments with the
Pathfinder network that aggregation after
decomposition provides a means by which we can
reduce inference times in the Pathfinder network
substantially. AD is a hybrid approach between
Pearl's conditioning method and Lauritzen and
Spiegel halter's
clique-tree p ropagation.
Additional hybrid approaches that combine
exact probabilistic-inference algorithms are
possible. Such approaches may provide the key
to tailoring inference algorithms to the structure
of the belief-network knowledge base of an expert
system.
