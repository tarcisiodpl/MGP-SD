We propose a new class of learning algorithms
that combines variational approximation and
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simu­
lation.

Naive algorithms that use the vari­

ational approximation as proposal distribu­
tion can perform poorly because this approx­
imation tends to underestimate the true vari­
ance and other features of the data.

We

solve this problem by introducing more so­

tion.

For instance, the posterior distribution, which

is the solution to the Bayesian learning problem, is
obtained by computing the normalising integral. Sim­
ilarly, in statistical mechanics, the Gibbs distribution
is obtained by computing the partition function (the
large normalising sum). The most popular integration
methods for calculating these important target distri­
butions are the Laplace method, variational approxi­

We also present an adaptive MCMC algo­

algorithms on the problem of Bayesian pa­
rameter estimation for logistic (sigmoid) be­

Variational approximation also relies on approximat­
ing the integrand. Yet, it approximates the integrand
by a lower bound that makes the integral tractable
and that results in a lower bound on the integral. The
approximation error is then minimized by maximising
the lower bound. In other words, we replace the in­
tegration problem by an easier optimization problem.
Variational methods have been shown to provide fast
and reasonable approximate estimates in many scenar­
ios (Jaakkola and Jordan 1999, Jordan, Ghahramani,

Jaakkola and Saul1999). However, variational approx�
imations often result in algorithms that yield poor es­

This problem is circumvented

by drawing samples from a proposal distribution, and
then using Markov chain weighing mechanisms to en­
sure that these samples correspond to samples from
the target distribution. The main difficulty with this
approach is that the design of the proposal distribu­

VARIATIONAL METHOD

The aim of variational methods is to convert a complex
problem into a simpler, more tractable problem; see for
example (Jordan et al. 1999). The simpler problem is
generally characterized by a decoupling of the degrees
of freedom in the original problem. This decoupling is
achieved by introducing an extra set of parameters, the
so-called variational parameters. The variational pa­
rameters are then optimized so that the solution to the

Lower bounds on the likelihood can be easily obtained

using Jensen's inequality

The resulting algo­

rithm converges quickly to the regions of high proba­
bility and also yields reasonable approximations to the
entire distribution of interest. Our approach makes it
possible to combine variational and MCMC algorithms
within a rigorous probabilistic setting so as to exploit
the benefits of both approaches.

We also introduce

using a variational approximation for mixtures of fac­

the results. The approach we take here is more general

and surmounts many of the problems encountered in
the importance sampling approach.
We demonstrate the approach on the task of Bayesian
parameter estimation of logistic (sigmoidal) belief net­

for several reasons. F irst, it exhibits nonlinearity and
non-Gaussianity. Second, it includes the problems of
logistic regression and classification with missing ob­

formative and consequently one has to be very careful

Each pro­

Obviously,

choosing the size of the blocks poses some trade-offs.
If one samples the components of a multi-dimensional

vector one at a time, the chain may take a very

long time to explore the target distribution.

This

problem gets worse as the correlation between the
components increases.

Alternatively, if one samples

all the components together, then the probability of

Mixtures of MCMC Kernels

A very powerful property of MCMC is that it is pos­
sible to combine several samplers into mixtures and

cycles of the individual samplers (Robert and Casella
1999). This way we can have global proposals to ex­
plore large regions of the parameter space and local
proposals to discover finer details of the target distri­
bution (Andrieu and Doucet 1999, Andrieu, de Freitas
and Doucet 2000). If the transition kernels K1 and
K2 have invariant distribution p(·) each, then the cy­
cle hybrid kernel K1K2 and the mixture hybrid kernel
vK1 + (1- v)K2, for 0 :=; v :=; 1, are also transition ker­
nels with invariant distribution p(·). In this paper, we
adopt a mixture where, with probability v, we sample
(J using the variational block MCMC algorithm and,
with probability 1 - v, we carry out a random walk
Metropolis step (also in blocks). The variational pro­
posal locks into a region of high probability while the
random walk allows one to explore the space around
this region. This allows us to accomplish both rapid
mixing and reasonable exploration of the target distri­
bution.

in Figure 2. To illustrate this, we generated data 4
times using the same model with the parameter set
to 1. Each realization of the data gave us a different
likelihood (and posterior). Hence, if we were to have
a model that represents the posterior well, it is not
guaranteed to predict well. The noise model is too un­
informative and, therefore, poorly suited to predictive
testing techniques such as cross-validation. The prob­
lem is exacerbated as the dimension of the parameter
space increases. We also performed experiments on
multimodal distributions that show the performance
of the algorithm not only in terms of approximating
the mean, but in terms of approximating more com­
plex aspects of the posterior distribution.

Adaptive Variational MCMC

The goal of adaptation is to update the proposal
distribution based on the behaviour of the Markov
chain. That is, we start an MCMC simulation with
an initial variational approximation, and then use the
MCMC samples to update the variational approxima­
tion. This results on a better variational approxima­
tion and faster mixing. However, one should not al­
low adaptation to take place infinitely often as this
can disturb the stationary distribution and the consis­
tency results. This problem arises because by using
the past information infinitely often, we violate the
Markov property of the transition kernel. That is,
Pr(O(i)IO(oJ,o(ll, ... ,oCi-1)) does no longer simplify
to Pr(O(i) [O(i-1}). We can avoid this problem by per­
forming adaptation only when the chain visits a par­
ticular atomic set. At this atomic set, the chain regen­
erates and, hence, the next tour becomes independent
of the past tour. We adopt an algorithm based on this
principle which was proposed by Gilks, Roberts and
Sahu (1998).
SIMULATIONS

We performed experiments on fully and partially ob­
served logistic BNs. When all the nodes are observed,
the posterior is unimodal. This allows us to compare
the algorithms in high dimensions by evaluating the
distance between their estimates of the mean and the
optimal mean. The likelihood, using a flat prior so
that it is close to the posterior, will be higher for es­
timates close to the optimal posterior mean. We used
this performance test because the optimal mean can
be very different from the generating mean as shown

Unimodal Models

We used logistic models consisting of one child and a
varying number of parents, ranging from 1 to 50. We
generated sets of 1000 data samples from these mod­
els. We computed posterior approximations using the
variational EM algorithm, the block M-H sampler with
the variational proposal distribution (VarMCMC), the
random walk Metropolis (RW), and the MCMC mix­
ture with a variational kernel and a Metropolis ker­
nel (VarMixMCMC). We repeated this experiment 10
times to obtain estimates of the performance in terms
of means and error bars. We set the random walk vari­
ance to 0.01, the bias parameter to 0.5, the Bernoulli
mean to 0.5 and the generating parameters to uni­
formly random values on (0, 1]. We chose a fairly flat
prior N(O, 1001). The results for 500 and 5000 samples

forms the standard variational algorithm. The perfor­
mance of the RW depends on the initialization and
data set realization. That is, it might or might not
perform well depending on whether it is initialized in
regions of high probability or not. Of course, as the
number of samples goes to infinity, the RW algorithm
will approximate the mean according to the central
limit theorem. Yet, in practical scenarios we often
need reliable and faster options. The computational

In this experiment, we considered a network with two
parents (one hidden and one observed). The posterior
for (} is, therefore, bivariate and can have two modes.
(Note that the two modes appear because of unidenti­
fiability. Either of these modes provides a statistically
valid solution.) For demonstration, we set the gener­
ating parameters for the hidden and observed nodes
to 2 and -1 and the respective Bernoulli means of the
hidden variables to 0.6 and 0.5. We set the bias pa­
rameter to 2, the number of data 50 and the prior to
N(3, 10!). The posterior in this case can be evaluated
numerically on a two-dimensional grid. We show its
contour curves in Figure 5. This figure also shows the
contour plot of the RW MCMC histogram after 5000
iterations and the variational approximation. We no­
tice that the variational approximation fits closely to
one of the modes. We also notice that if the random
walk starts in a region of low probability, it can take
long to locate one of the modes. Its performance will,
therefore, be poor when dealing with posteriors with
elongated contours. Figure 6 illustrates the point that
the naive variational MCMC algorithm locates one of

CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER
WORK

combine variational and MCMC methods. Variational
methods allow us to map the problem under consider­
ation to a subset of simpler problems. By solving these
subproblems we obtain suboptimal distributions, that
can in turn be used as proposals for more complex sam­

pling schemes. We pointed out that naive algorithms

based on this principle can perform poorly because

the variational approximation tends to underestimate
the variance of the posterior distribution. We there­
fore proposed more sophisticated MCMC algorithms
that are clearly able to benefit from the variational ap­
proximation and outperform standard Metropolis al­
gorithms.
