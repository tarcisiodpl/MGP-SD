We describe two experiments that apply the architec­

ism from a set of documents from the Reuters news

to automat­

then reason about them given the evidence provided
by individual documents. As in our previous research
on concept-based methods

[12, 16, 17],

our goal has

been to develop techniques that can be used to sup­
port a specific class of information retrieval problems.
Specifically, we believe that the ideas we present here
can form the basis for an effective sy stem to assist
users in sorting through large volumes of time sensi­
tive material. We have in mind such applications as
the day-to-day monitoring of newswires for specific
topics of interest.
The architecture of a generic concept-based system
is shown in Figure

A knowledge base contains a

set of concepts together with their qualitative

(i.e.,

structural) and quantitative relationships with other
concepts.

Queries specify a user's information need

in terms of these concepts. When a new document
is presented with respect to a particular query, fea­
tures are extracted from the document. The features
currently used are the presence or absence of certain

Thus, concept-based methods view information re­
trieval primarily as a problem of evidential reason­
ing. However, while they can provide improved per­
formance over more conventional techniques, they do
require large amounts of effort to acquire the con­
cepts and their relationships. Our current research
attempts to address this weakness with the use of
new probabilistic methods to represent, reason about,
and learn the relationships between concepts. While
probabilistic methods have been recognized as an im­
portant evidential reasoning technology with well­
defined semantics (e.g., frequency, strength-of-belief)
and solid theoretical foundations, they have often
been passed over because of their computational com­
plexity. Their use in information retrieval has also
been limited, although many authors have recognized
the benefits of employing such techniques [2, 11; 14].
The probabilistic network technology [7, 13) is a re­
cent development which is computationally tractable.
A probabilistic network is a graph of nodes and arcs
where the nodes represent uncertain variables and
the arcs represent relationships between the variables.
Computationally efficient algorithms have been de­
veloped which perform inference. The technology has
been applied to a wide variety of problems includ­
ing medical diagnosis, machine vision, petroleum ex­
ploration, military situation assessment, and multi­
target tracking. Some initial work has applied this
technology to information retrieval in hypertext [3, 5].

tionships between variables through experience (i.e.,
data). CoNSTRUCTOR [6] is a system for building
probabilistic networks from data. It serves as the pri­
mary mechanism for learning about the relationship
between concepts.

In the following section of the paper, we discuss both

probabilistic networks and the CONSTRUCTOR sys­
tem in more detail, and then, in Section 3, we de­
scribe the PCIR architecture. In Sections 4 and 5,
we present the results of two exploratory experiments
that show how we might use these techniques for
concept-based retrieval. We conclude, in Section 6,
with some comments and conclusions on the utility
of the ideas we have presented.

Component Technologies

The two major component technologies of PCIR are
probabilistic networks and CONSTRUCTOR.
2.1

Probabilistic Networks

Probabilistic networks is a technology for represent­
ing and reasoning with uncertain beliefs, and is based
on the well-established theory of Bayesian probabil­
ity. A successor to decision tree technology, proba­
bilistic networks have been shown to be to be more
Because of the clear semantics behind probabilistic understandable and computationally more tractable
networks, it is possible to identify and quantify rela- than the older technology. These advantages are

achieved primarily through one innovation: the ex­
plicit representation of relevance relations between
factors modeled in the network.

In a Markov network, relationships between nodes
are also indicated with arcs but represented in a dif­
ferent way. Probabilistic models are associated with
the diques (i.e., maximally connected subset) of a
network instead of individual nodes.
Relevance relations are specified by the connectivity
of the network-what arcs are placed between what
nodes, and in what direction. The concept of rele­
vance in a Bayesian network is related loosely with
graph separation and can be illustrated by exami­
nation of Figure 2. If it is known that the concept
killing is present in a document, then the structure
of the network implies that any other known infor­
mation (e.g., the concept terrorism is present in the
document) will be irrelevant to beliefs about whether
the shooting is present in the document. This is
because the node killing separates the node shooting
from every other node in the graph. Similarly, if it is
known that the concepts politician and terrorism
are both present in a document then any other piece
of known information is irrelevant to whether the con­
cept subject is present in the document. These rel­
evance relations are useful not only from a qualita­
tive point of view, but are also useful in reducing the
amount of quantitative information needed and the
amount of computational resources needed in infer­
ence.

There are two major types of probabilistic net­
works, Bayesian networks which contain directed arcs
and Markov networks which contain undirected arcs.
Both types are used in PCIR. There are two types of
nodes: state and evidence nodes. A state node repre­
sents a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
set of propositions about which there is uncertainty.
A state node is represented graphically by a circle.
For example, whether a document is or is not about
terrorism may be uncertain. To model this situation,
the two propositions "this document is about ter­
rorism" and "this document is not about terrorism"
could be represented by a state node in a probabilistic
network. An evidence node represents an observation
and is represented graphically with a rectangle. For
example, the observation that the word "bombing"
is contained as a document may be represented as a Useful inferences can be made given a probabilis­
tic network that represents a situation and evidence

tion of the data but, perhaps more importantly, also
contain a qualitative structural description of the
data. By qualitative structure we mean, loosely, the
positive and negative cau1al relationships between
factors as well as the positive and negative correla­
tive relationships between factors in the processes un­
der analysis. CoNSTRUCTOR has as a primary focus
the recovery of qualitative structures since structure
not only determines which quantitative relationships
are recovered, but also because such structure have
been found to be cognitively stable [8] and thus are
valuable in explaining the real world processes under
analysis.
The CoNSTRUCTOR system is built upon techniques
and research results from the fields of probabilistic
networks, artificial intelligence (AI), and statistics.
The probabilistic network technologies are central to
the CoNSTRUCTOR system since they not only pro­
vide the representation language for CONSTRUCTOR
results but, more importantly, provide the concep­
tual impetus-the identification of conditional inde­
pendence relations-that drives the CoNSTRUCTOR
system.

low for a computationally efficient implementation.
From classical statistics, we make use of the x2 test
for probabilistic independence and from the newer
field of computer-intensive statistical analysis [4] we
make use of crou-validation to prevent "overfitting"
of models to data.
The CONSTRUCTOR algorithm works by finding the
complete set of (graphical) neighbors for each feature
in the data set. The neighbor relations for each fea­
ture can then be used to identify the structure of a
belief network. The complete set of neighbors for a
feature is called the Markov boundary. The neigh­
bors are identifiable as the smallest set of features
such that all other features are conditionally inde­
pendent of that feature given any fixed set of values
for the feature's neighbors.

Network identification involves successively finding
the neighbor1 of each attribute in the training set.
Despite these observations, managing the exponen­
tial process of finding neighbors is the primary chal­
lenge for the network identification task. Finding the

tion that the CoNSTRUCTOR-induced network is close
to being correct and the fact that the network is
sparse (i.e., has few arcs). Out of the 153 possible
arcs between the 18 concept nodes of the graph, only
12 of the arcs are instantiated. In addition, there
are the 82 connections to the 82 evidence (e.g., fea­
ture) nodes. In contrast, consider the situation if all
the concept nodes except the terrorism node were re­
moved from the graph by probabilistic manipulation.
The resulting graph would be extremely dense. This
would correspond to the situation of deriving proba­
bilistic relations between terrorism and the features
directly.

We believe that the experimental results presented
above provide positive evidence that the PCIR ar­
chitecture design is feasible. The choice of prob­
abilistic networks for the knowledge base represen­
tation provides for an intuitive and well-defined se­
mantics for acquiring knowledge either from an ex­
pert or automatically. The first experiment shows
that reasonable performance can be obtained through
use of probabilistic networks as the evidential rea­
soning mechanism for concept-based information re­
