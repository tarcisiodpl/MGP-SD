The graphoid axioms f o r conditional
independence, originally described by Dawid
[1979], are fundamental to probabilistic
reasoning [Pearl, 1988]. Such axioms provide a
mechanism for manipulating conditional
independence assertions without resorting to their
numerical definition. This paper explores a
representation for independence statements using
multiple undirected graphs and some simple
graphical transformations. The independence
statements derivable in this system are equivalent
to those obtainable by the graphoid axioms.
Therefore, this is a purely graphical proof
technique for conditional independence.

INTRODUCTION

The graphoid Axioms for conditional independence were
originally proposed as the fundamental theme behind
statistical inference[Dawid, 1979]. Since then, they have
come to be accepted as a complete characterization and

definition of conditional independence, applicable to many
situations far beyond probabilistic models [Fagin, 1977;
Geiger and Pearl, 1990b; Pearl, 1988; Pearl et al., 1990;
Smith, 1989; Smith, 1990; Verma and Pearl, 1988].

This article explores a graphical way of representing
independence statements using multiple undirected graphs
first suggested in [Shachter, 1990]. Its main contribution
is showing that repeatedly applying two graphical
transformations, node deletion and graph combination, is
equivalent to repeatedly applying the graphoid axioms.
Consequently a purely graphical method of deriving new
independence statements from a given set of such
statements is obtained. The graphical operations have the
advantage of an intuitive representation in undirected
graphs, which makes the structure of independence

assumed in a model explicit. They have the potential for
making the abstract notion of conditional independence
more accessible for teaching and knowledge acquisition.
Nonetheless, although the technique is simple to use
manually, its complexity is exponential, as are the
derivation steps using the graphoid axioms.
The key to these graphical operations is the multiple
undirected graph framework developed by Paz[l987; 1988]
and Geiger[l987]. Many people have looked at undirected
graph representations for the graphoid axioms, but they
have always kept the intersection axiom, restricting the
applicability to purely positive probability distributions
and limiting the possible generalizations beyond
probability [Pearl, 1988]. The key result underlying this
paper is the development of a system which incorporates
the contraction axiom but docs not incorporate the
intersection axiom.
Section 2 presents the notation and basic principles of the
graphoid axioms while Section 3 defines the framework of
Multiple Undirected Graphs and the graphical
transformations on them.
Section 4 proves the
equivalence between the two axiom systems. Section 5
extends the graphical operations to some important special
cases while Section 6 presents examples of theoretical
properties, practical applications, and efficient
computational structures which follow from the axioms.

NOTATION AND BASIC
CONCEPTS

The notation and framework used throughout the paper is
described in this section.
The primitive entities in a model are a finite set of
elements U. In a probabilistic model, these correspond
to random variables. A single element or set of elements

will be denoted by a capital letter, such as X, Y, or Z.
These elements are associated with nodes in an undirected
graph. For Sections 3 and 4, it will be assumed that each

354

Shachter

node corresponds to a single element, but in Section 5
this will be generalized to allow multiple elements to be
associated with a single node. For readability, a node will
be referred to by the element(s) associated with it. For
example, if element X is associated with a particular node,
then that node will also be called X.
A dependency model over a finite set of elements U is
a three place predicate I( X, Z, Y) where X, Z, and Y are
disjoint subsets of U. The intended interpretation of I( X,
Z, Y ) is that X is conditionally independent of Y given
Z. Alternatively, having observed Z, no additional
information about X could be obtained by also observing
Y. For example, in a probabilistic model, I( X, Z, Y )
holds if and only if
P{ X I Z, Y }

=

In this section and the following section, it is assumed
that each node corresponds to exactly one element. In
section 5 this will be generalized to allow multiple
elements in a node, and the graph separation rule will
apply even when the sets X, Y, and Z are not disjoint.

a)� b)�

P{ X I Z } whenever P{ Z } > 0

for every value of the variables X, Y, and Z.
The realization of I need not necessarily be probabilistic
[Fagin, 1977; Geiger and Pearl, 1990a; Geiger and Pearl,
1990b; Geiger et al., 1990; Pearl, 1988; Pearl et al.,
1990; Smith, 1989; Smith, 1990; Verma and Pearl,
19881.
All of the those formulations satisfy the
following g r a p h o i d axioms, first proposed by
Dawid[l9791:
Symmetry: I( X, Z, Y) �

Decomposition:
Weak Union:

I( Y, Z, X )

I( X, Z, Y u W) => I( X, Z, Y ) ;

I( X, Z, Y u W) => I( X, Z u Y, W) ;

Contraction:

I( X, Z u Y, W) and I( X, Z, Y)
=> I( X, Z, Y u W) .

The essence of these axioms is that learning an irrelevant
proposition does not change the status of other facts;
every proposition that was irrelevant remains irrelevant
and every proposition that was relevant remains relevant.
These axioms are not complete for probabilistic
independence [Geiger and Pearl, 1990aJ, but are
nevertheless powerful enough to derive useful
consequences that generalize from probabilistic
independence. We shall next used sets of undirected
graphs for deriving such consequences.

MULTIPLE UNDIRECTED GRAPHS

The representation of independence by Multiple Undirected
Graphs was studied by Paz[l987; 19881 and Geiger[I987].
We will see below how it can be used as a visual
technique for deriving new independence statements from a
given list of such statements.
Conditional independence is represented in an undirected
graph by graph separation: given three disjoint sets of
elements from U, X, Y, and Z, Z separates X from Y if
every path between X and Y contains an element from Z.
For example, Z separates X from Y in the graph shown in
Figure Ia representing I( X, Z, Y), but there is no
independence represented in the graph shown in Figure 1 b.

A multiple undirected graph (MUG) M over U is a
dependency model consisting of a set of undirected graphs
containing elements from U. An independence statement
I( X, Z, Y) holds in M if and only if there exists a graph
in M containing X u Y u Z in which Z separates X from
Y. Alternatively, I( X, Z, Y) is said to be satisfied by
M, or M satisfies it. Suppose for example that the
graphs shown in Figures Ia and Ib constitute a MUG.
Then I( X, Z, Y ) even though there is no independence
represented in the second graph.
Two dependency models are equivalent if they represent
the same list of independence statements. The following
transformations add undirected graphs to a given MUG,
producing a new MUG that is equivalent to the original
one. Given any graph G in a MUG, then the MUG
obtained by duplicating G and adding any arcs is said to be
derived by arc addition. Given any graph G in a MUG
M, then the MUG obtained from M by duplicating G and
deleting any node after adding arcs between all of the nodes
which had been adjacent to it is said to be derived by node
deletion.
Both arc addition and node deletion follow directly from
graph separation, since any separation present in the new
graph must also have been present in the original graph.
In the example graph drawn in Figure l c an arc is added
between Z and Y to obtain the graph shown in Figure I d.
Node X can be deleted from the graph shown in Figure Ic
to create the graph shown in l e, but only after an arc is
added between Z and Y, the nodes adjacent to X, to obtain

A Graph-Based Inference Method for Conditional Independence

the graph shown in Figure !d. Although X separates Y
from ZuW, that separation can no longer be represented
once X is deleted. Instead the fact that there is a path from
Z to Y through X requires that X and Y be connected in
the new graph. This leads to the following result
Theorem 1.

Let M be a MUG. Then a MUG derived
from M by node deletion or arc addition is equivalent
to M.

Next we define a new transformation which does not
produce an equivalent MUG because it adds independence
statements not represented in the original MUG. Let M
be a MUG over U, and X, Y, and Z be disjoint subsets of
U. If M satisfies I( X, Z, Y ) and there is a graph G in M
for which X u Z is the set of all of the nodes, then the
MUG obtained from M by duplicating G, adding to the
new graph nodes for each element in Y, and connecting
every pair of nodes in Y u Z with an arc is said to be
derived by graph combination.
Graph combination synthesizes a new graph from two
others. Consider the graph drawn in Figure If in which
(Zl u Z2) separates (XI u X2) from (Yl u Y2), while
the graph drawn in Figure l g contains only the elements
(XI u X2) u (Zl u Z2). Using graph combination, a
new graph is formed as shown in Figure !h. In the
process, arcs are added between all of the nodes in (Yl u
Y2)u (Zl u Z2). Note that Z l separates XI from (Yl
uY2) which could not be determined from either of the
original graphs.
4.

GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE GRAPHOID AXIOMS

The thrust o f this paper is to show that graph
combination and node deletion add all and only those
independence statements derivable by the graphoid axioms.
Consequently, these transformations provide a graph-based
technique for proving all independence statements implied
by the graphoid axioms (and none other) from a given
input set of independence statements. The input for our
proof technique can be specified either by a list of
undirected graphs, or a list of independence statements, or
a combination thereof. This proof technique is quite
useful because the graphoid axioms are strong enough to
prove powerful results [Verma and Pearl, 1988].
Theorem 2.

Let M be a MUG and let I be the set of
independence statements satisfied by M. An
independence statement I is derivable by the graphoid
axioms from I if and only if there exists a sequence of
node deletions and graph combinations on M that
produces a MUG in which I is satisfied.

Proof:

Let I be a statement derived from I using the graphoid
axioms. Let O'J ...<Jk be a derivation chain of I. That is,
<Jk equals I and each O'i is either an independence statement
in I or it has been derived by the graphoid axioms from O' l

... O' i-1· Next, we construct a sequence of graphical
transformations that would end with a MUG that satisfies
I. The proof is done by induction on k.
When k is one, then since O' l is in I, there exists a graph
in M where O'l is satisfied. Otherwise, O'i is derived from
previous statements by one of the graphoid axioms.
Suppose O'i is derived from some O'j (i > jby symmetry.
Consider the graph in which O'j is satisfied. The same
graph satisfies O'i as well since if Z separates X from V it
must also separate V from X.
Otherwise, O' i must have been derived from previous
statements using decomposition, weak union, or
contraction. To verify that the same statement could be
obtained graphically, consider the graphs drawn in Figure
2, representing the graphoid axioms. If the previous
statement is I(X, Z, Y u W), as shown in the graph
drawn in Figure 2c, then weak union and decomposition ,
shown in the graphs drawn in Figure 2a and 2b,
respectively, are recognized graphically since Z separates
X from Y, and Z u Y separates X from W. If the
previous statements are I(X, Z u Y, W) and I(X, Z, Y)
then a result equivalent to the contraction axiom can be
obtained using graph combination. Because I(X, Z uY,
W) and there is a graph containing only X u (Zu Y),
that graph can be duplicated, adding to it nodes for W and
connecting every pair of nodes in Wu(Z u Y) to obtain
the graph shown in Figure 2c in which Z separates X
from YuW.

Figure 2: The Graphoid Axioms

Now suppose Mt ... M k is a sequence of MUGs, M k
satisfies I, and every Mi is obtained from the previous
ones by either node deletion or graph combination. It
must be shown that I can be derived by the graphoid
axioms from the independence statements encoded in Mt,
i.e., from I. The proof is done by induction on k. The
basis k=l holds since I is satisfied by the given MUG.
Suppose M i is derived from Mj by node deletion
performed on graph G. Let G' be the added graph with a
deleted node. Since any statement I represented by G'
must also hold in G, it need not be derived.
Similarly, in the case of graph combination, it can be
shown that every statement added is derivable using the
graphoid axioms.

EXTENSIONS TO THE
GRAPHICAL OPERATIONS

In this section, the Graphical Axioms are generalized by
relaxing the assumptions, made in Section 3, that each
node is associated with a single element, and that
independence relations are defined only on disjoint sets.
These extensions require no changes to the graphical
operations, but they greatly increase their power.
First, it is necessary to generalize the graphoid axioms to
define independence relations even when the three sets of
elements are not disjoint. This is accomplished through
an additional axiom [Pearl, 1988]:
Overlap:

I( X, Z, Y ) (:) I( X Z, Z, Y Z ) .

Thus I( X, Z, Y ) is possible when X, Y, and Z are not
disjoint if X n Y c Z . No modifications to the
graphical operations are required, since Z separates X from
Y if every path between X and Y contains an element of
Z. This condition can be satisfied when some of the
elements of X and Y are also elements of Z. For
example, consider the graph shown in Figure 3a). Since
Z separates X from Y it follows that I( X, Z, Y ), but also
I( X u Z, Z, Y u Z), I( X u Z, Z, Y ) and I( X, Z, Y u
Z ). It is not usually possible, however, to separate two
overlapping sets of elements unless their intersection is
included in the separating set.

Figure 3: Properties with Multiple Elements in a Node

Now that the definition of independence has been extended,
it is possible to have multiple elements be assigned to the
same node and also to have the same element assigned to
multiple nodes. This leads to two additional graphical
transformations. Given any graph G in a MUG M, then
the MUG obtained from M by duplicating G and replacing
two nodes Z l and Z2 with one node Z containing the
union of the elements associated with Z1 and Z2 is said to
be derived by node merging. In the new graph, arcs
must be drawn between node Z and any node which had
been adjacent to node Z l or node Z2. Given any graph G
in a MUG M, then the MUG obtained from M by
duplicating G and replacing one node Z with two nodes Zl

and Z2 which together contain all of the elements
associated with Z is said to be derived by n o d e
splitting.
In the new graph, arcs must be drawn
between nodes Z l and Z2, and between them and any node
which had been adjacent to node Z.
The node merging and node splitting properties follow
directly from the extended notion of graph separation, in
that any separation present after the change must have
been present beforehand. In the case of node merging,
separation by the new node is equivalent to separation by
both old nodes, while after node splitting, separation by
both new nodes is equivalent to separation by the old one.
In either case, any path present beforehand will be
maintained. Consider the example graphs shown in
Figure 3. Arcs are added to the graph drawn in part a) to
obtain the graph drawn in part b). The Z and Y nodes are
then merged to obtain the graph drawn in part c). The
transition from part a) to part c could, of course, be done
as a single step. If the ZY node in the graph drawn in part
c) is now split, it results in the graph drawn in part b). It
would not be possible to infer the graph drawn in part a)
from the graph drawn in part c), so conditional
independence information is lost in the process of Node
Merging. This leads to the following result.
Theorem 3.

Let M be a MUG. Then a MUG derived
from M by node splitting or node merging is
equivalent to M.

An example of a graph with repeated elements is shown in
the Figure 3e. Note that if the same element appears in
two different nodes, then it should appear in every node on
a path between them, since it can only be separated from
itself by itself, and thus the graph shown in Figure 3f
would usually be in error. A graph G with multiple
elements in a node can always be transformed into another
graph G' with single elements in a node. An arc should
be drawn between two nodes in G' if and only if their
elements were in the same or adjacent nodes in G.

EXAMPLES

The graphical operations are useful because they allow us
to conceptualize abstract conditional independence and to
derive easily results which arise from the graphoid
Axioms. These sections describe some different types of
results which can be derived using the graphical
operations.
6. 1

ADDITIONAL

PROPERTIES

Pearl [Pearl, 1988] describes some additional properties
related to conditional independence. The graphical
operations allow us to derive easily those which apply and
to recognize those which do not. These properties, in
independence notation are:

A Graph-Based Inference Method for Conditional Independence

Mixing:
Chaining:
Intersection:

I( X u Y, Z, W ) and I( X, Z, Y )
� I( X, Z, Y u W );

I( X u Z, Y, W ) and I( X, Z, Y )
� I( X, Z, W ); and

I( X, Z u Y, W ) and I( X, Z u W, Y )
¢== I( X, Z, Y u W ) .

We consider each in tum using the graphs drawn in Figure
4.
The Mixing Property assumptions are represented in the
graphs drawn in parts a) and b).
Using graph
combination, the graph drawn in part c) can be constructed
from the one in part b) by adding node W and an arc
between Z and W. The resulting graph not only shows
that Z separates X from Y u W, but also the symmetry
by which Z separates all of the elements from each other.
It is simple to verify that the graphs shown in parts a) and
b) can be obtained from the graph shown in part c) by
either arc addition or node deletion. Mixing is a useful
property since it together with symmetry and
decomposition have been shown to completely
characterize marginal independence [Geiger et a!., 1991].

Figure 4: Additional Properties on MUGs

The Chaining Property conditions are represented in the
graphs drawn in parts d) and e). Again graph combination
allows the graph drawn in part f) to be constructed from
the one in part e) by adding node W and an arc between Y
and Z. Clearly Z separates X from W in the new valid
graph, but it is also more apparent why this is called
"chaining." It is again simple to obtain the graphs shown
in parts d) and e) from the graph shown in part f) by arc
addition and node deletion.

Finally, the conditions for the Intersection Property are
satisfied by the graphs drawn in parts g) and h). However,
graph combination can not be applied directly, since both
graphs are on the same elements, X u Y u Z u W. If
any nodes are deleted from either of the graphs, there is no
conditional independence remaining, and it is not possible
to obtain the graph shown in part i). This is as it should
be, because the Intersection Property is not true in
general, but rather requires further assumptions. (In the
case of probabilistic models, for example, all of the joint
probabilities must be strictly positive.) The graph shown
in part i) could be obtained if the conditions corresponded
to the graphs shown in parts g) and e), rather than g) and
h). On the other hand, the graphs shown in parts g) and
h) can be obtained from the graph shown in part i)
through arc addition.
6.2

DIRECTED GRAPHS, MORAL
GRAPHS, AND JOIN TREES

In practice, probabilistic models are most easily assessed
in the form of a directed graph, called an influence diagram
or belief network [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Pearl,
1986b). For most efficient computation these models can
then be converted into undirected graphs, called moral
graphs [Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988), and then into
trees of overlapping sets of nodes, called join trees [Beeri
et al., 1983; Jensen et al., 1990a; Jensen et al., 1990b).
In this section, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with these concepts, so that the focus will be on insights
to be gained from the Graphical Axioms.
The directed graph can be thought of as a sequence of
conditional independence statements: each element is
conditionally independent of the elements listed before it,
given its parents in the graph. In fact, the conditional
independence does not apply to any particular sequence,
but rather to any ordering consistent with the graph. This
property is well known [Pearl, 1988; Smith, 1989], but it
can also be proven directly through the Graphical Axioms
[Shachter, 1990) .
This sequence of conditional independence statements can
be used to construct the moral graph through repeated
application of the Combination Property. Each new
element can be added in tum to the undirected graph under
construction by adding its node and arcs between it and its
parents and among its parents. (This is the marrying of
the parents which gives "moral" graphs their name.) Thus
the directed graph shown in Figure Sa) has the moral
graph shown in part b) (ignoring the dashed (L, B) arc to
be discussed below). Moralizing arcs (T, L) and (E, B) are
added between the parents of E and D, respectively. Note
that we really have a sequence of moral graphs, including
the one shown in part c), revealing independence not
shown in the full moral graph. This is why the MUG
representation is needed in general.

Figure 5: Directed Graph, Moral Graphs, and Join Trees

For efficient inference, it is ideal to have an undirected
graph in the form of a tree [Jensen et a!., 1990a; Jensen et
a!., 1990b; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Pearl,
1988]. In general this cannot be accomplished with nodes
corresponding to single elements, but instead requires
nodes with sets of elements and some elements assigned
to multiple nodes. Such trees are shown in parts d) and
e). They are join trees, because whenever an element
appears in two different nodes, it appears in every node on
the path between them. Recall that this is just the
necessary property for assignment of elements to multiple
nodes described in Section 5. Note that, given the
independence represented in the directed graph, the join tree
is a valid graph. To capture all of that independence,
however, we need the graph in part d) rather than the one
in part e). Notice that through the insertion of separation
sets, containing the intersection of neighboring node sets,
we create a graph in which the only arcs needed for a
single element graph such as the one in part b) are
between elements in the same node in part d). When we
create the graph in part b) in this manner, it has become a
chordal graph with the addition of the dashed arc (L, B)
[Becri et al., 1983].
6.3

DETERMINISTIC ELEMENTS AND
SEPARATION

The independence properties in the directed graph have
been extensively studied [Geiger et a!., 1989; Geiger et
al., 1990; Pearl, 1986a; Pearl, 1988; Shachter, 1988;
Shachter, 1990; Verma and Pearl, 1988], but recent work
has shown how they can be recognized in the undirected
graph [Lauritzen et al., 1990]. Unfortunately, one type of
independence appears difficult to represent in the undirected
graph: elements which are deterministically related to
other elements. Nonetheless the results of Lauritzen et
al[1990] can be extended in the undirected graph to
recognize independence in models with deterministic

An element in a directed graph is said to be deterministic
and drawn with a double oval if it is conditionally
independent of all elements, including itself, given its
parents. In a probabilistic model, such an element can be
described as a deterministic function of its parents. For
example, in the diagram shown in Figure 6a), the element
B is a deterministic function of A. When an element is
deterministic, an operation called determin istic
propagation [Shachtcr, 1988; Shachter, 1990) can be
applied to the graph: the children of the deterministic
node have their arc from the deterministic node replaced by
arcs from its parents. For example, after deterministic
propagation, the graph drawn in part a) is transformed into
the graph drawn in part b). Such an operation can be
interpreted in probabilistic models as substitution of the
deterministic function into the children's distributions, but
it can also be derived in general using the graphical
operations [Shachter, 1990]. In the case of the example,
we can justify deterministic propagation by considering
the moral graphs for the graphs in parts a) and b) shown
in parts c) and d), respectively. To obtain the moral graph
shown in part d) from the one shown in part c), first delete
the node B, and then use the Combination Property,
recognizing that because node B is deterministic, I( B, A,
CuD ).

Figure 6: Managing Deterministic Elements

Using the property of deterministic propagation, the
independence test of Lauritzen et al[1990] can be
generalized to problems with deterministic nodes, to test
for what is called D-separation [Geiger et a!., 1990;
Shachter, 1988; Shachter, 1990]. The procedure to test
whether I( X, Z, Y ) is satisfied in a directed graph,
possibly containing deterministic nodes, is as follows:
1.

Discard elements in the directed graph which are
not in X u Y u Z or one of their ancestors in
the directed graph.

2.

Visiting each element in graph order, perform
deterministic propagation on any deterministic
element which is not in Z.

3.

Form the moral graph of the resulting directed
graph.

4.

Determine whether Z separates X from Y in the
moral graph.

A Graph-Based Inference Method for Conditional Independence

This procedure is applied to some examples as shown in
Figure 7. First consider the directed graph shown in part
There are no deterministic elements and the
a).
corresponding moral graph is shown in part b). Clearly I(
W, Z, X u Y u V ). The entire moral graph is needed to
test the independence of element V from other elements,
and Z does not separate X from Y u V. However, to just
check whether I( X, Z, Y ), the element V is discarded
from the graph shown in part a) and the moral graph is
now the one shown in part c). In fact, in this case, I( X,
Z, Y ). Another example is the directed graph shown in
part d). Its moral graph is shown in part e) and clearly it
does not satisfy I( X, Z, Y ). If Z were not observed the
we would obtain the moral graph shown in part f), so I(
X, 0, Y ) is true.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, system of graphical transformations on
Multiple Undirected Graphs are defined and shown to be
equivalent to the graphoid axioms. These axioms have
become accepted as the fundamental properties of
conditional independence generalized from probabilistic
models. These graphical operations are illustrated with
examples related to theoretical properties, practical
applications, and efficient computations.
This
representation facilitates the communication and
development of intuition for the abstract definition of
conditional independence. Although stress has been placed
in this paper on the relative benefits of the new approach,
its equivalence to the graphoid axioms is especially
powerful in that it allows one to use whichever system is
convenient for the problem at hand. Unfortunately, the
complexity of both methods is exponential.
The essence of this paper is that graph based techniques
can help us to reason about independence relations. Pearl
and others have shown a dual aspect by which
independence helps us to characterize graphical
representations. Both views are useful for exploring the
connections between separation in graphs and
independence in probability.
