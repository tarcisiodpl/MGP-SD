We study the connection between kappa cal­
culus and probabilistic reasoning in diagnosis
applications. Specifically, we abstract a prob­
abilistic belief network for diagnosing faults
into a kappa network and compare the order­
ing of faults computed using both methods.
We show that, at least for the example exam­
ined, the ordering of faults coincide as long as
all the causal relations in the original prob­
abilistic network are taken into account . We
also provide a formal analysis of some net­
work structures where the two methods will
differ.
Both kappa rankings and infinitesimal prob­
abilities have been used extensively to study
default reasoning and belief revision. But lit­
tle has been done on utilizing their connec­
tion as outlined above.

This is partly be­

cause the relation between kappa and prob­
ability calculi assumes that probabilities are
arbitrarily close to one (or zero). The exper­
iments in this paper investigate this relation
when this assumption is not satisfied. The
reported results have important implications
on the use of kappa rankings to enhance the
knowledge engineering of uncertainty models.

Introduction

Bayesian reasoning has found widespread use in re­
cent years [12]. Applications based on Bayesian net­

works, for example, have spanned over diagnosis, fore­
casting, natural language understanding, and planning
[1]. But despite the popularity of Bayesian methods,
one of their key aspects has always stood in their way
to further success and wider use; namely, their com­
mitment to point probabilities. In particular, most
Bayesian techniques cannot commence without com­
mitting a domain expert to a full probability distri­
bution, which typically requires many probabilities to
be specified. Although recent advances in Bayesian
networks have reduced this problem by appealing to

conditional independences, there is still a significant
interest in reducing this problem even further given its
impact on knowledge elicitation and model building.
In recent years, a number of proposals have been ex­
tended for the purpose of relieving domain experts
from having to specify point probabilities.
Many
of these proposals offer concrete methods that allow
Bayesian reasoning to commence without a commit­
ment to a complete probability distribution. An exam­
ple of this is Qualitative Probabilistic Networks [18],

which allow one to reason about probabilistic influ­
ences among variables in a qualitative manner that is
consistent with Bayesian reasoning. A second class
of proposals attempts to relief experts from providing
point probabilities by requiring more abstract and in­
tuitive belief measures that are consistent with point
probabilities. A key proposal in this camp is kappa cal­
culus [16, 17] and its probabilistic interpretation using
€-semantics [8). In this framework, experts can pro­
vide beliefs in the form of if-then rules that are quan­
tified using order-of-magnitude probabilities. This

quantification can be naturally embedded into a causal
network, where the same set of Bayesian distributed
algorithms can be applied [10, 2].
Both kappa calculus and its probabilistic interpreta­
tion have been extensively studied from the perspec­
tive of belief revision, nonmonotonic and defeasible
reasoning [2, 8, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 15]. Kappa calculus
was also proposed as a qualitative version of proba­
bilistic reasoning in [9]. Yet, the formal relation be­
tween kappa calculus and probabilistic reasoning is es­
tablished under the assumption that probabilities are
extreme; that is, not only should they be close to one
or zero but also they should be arbitrarily so. This
requirement, which is never met in practice, means
that kappa calculus can be viewed as an abstraction

of probability calculus under the following acceptance
rule [7] : Even though probabilities may not be arbi­

trarily extreme, the agent is willing to assume and be­
have as if they were, thus transforming them into plain
beliefs quantified by kappa rankings that can be ma­
nipulated using kappa calculus .
The question we address in this paper is the follow-

146

Darwiche and Goldszmidt

ing: What are the consequences of adopting the ac­
ceptance rule? For example, what information is lost
once we are willing to take regular probabilities and
abstract them into plain beliefs to be processed by
kappa calculus? To answer these questions, we take
an empirical approach and use a diagnostic example
to test our hypothesis. Our results show that in spite
of differences in absolute beliefs, when it comes to or­
dering the set of faults, both standard probabilities
and their corresponding kappa rankings coincide most
of the time. Moreover, an analysis of the differences
between the two calculi led us to identify two causal
structures where using probabilities or kappa rankings
will yield different results.
The results in this paper are important for the knowl­
edge engineering of uncertainty models for the follow­
ing reasons:
1. Eliciting and building uncertainty models seems
to be an easier task in kappa calculus than in
probabilities. The kappa quantification of a net­
work can be performed using if-then rules and
ignorance can be specified by declaring that both
an event and its negation are possible.
2. Models are more robust in kappa calculus, since
small changes in the uncertainty will not affect
much the assignment of beliefs.
3. It seems easier to absorb the results of a proba­
bilistic inference once they are displayed as order­
of-magnitude approximations (kappa rankings) of
the actual probabilities.
4. There are indicators that algorithms based on ex­
treme probabilities [13] and kappa rankings [9] can
be faster than those based on regular probabili­
ties.
This paper is structured as follows. We overview kappa
calculus in Section 2 and then elaborate on its relation
with probability calculus in Section 3. Specifically, al­
though kappa calculus has been developed indepen­
dently of probability calculus, kappa rankings can
be viewed as order-of-magnitude probabilities when
these probabilities are arbitrarily high or low. In Sec­
tion 3, we provide a formal translation from point
probabilities to kappa rankings and outline the role
that this translation could play in practical systems,
where probabilities are not necessarily extreme. We
then report a number of experiments in Section 4 that
are designed to evaluate the proposed translation and
to assess the possible loss of information it could lead
to. The experiments are conducted in the context of a
diagnosis task. Some of the reported results lend them­
selves to formal analysis that we carry out in Section 5.
The key outcome of this analysis is an intuitive char­
acterization of kappa calculus on some of the causal
structures appearing in real world applications. Fi­
nally, Section 6 summarizes the main results and offers
another perspective on the connection between proba­
bilities and kappa rankings according to which kappa

rankings are strengths of default assumptions that are
extracted from probabilistic information. This connec­
tion is in the spirit of earlier work on extreme prob­
abilities and t-semantics [12] and provides a better
understanding of the connection between point prob­
abilities, kappa rankings and default priorities.

Kappa calculus

The original motivation behind kappa calculus was to
propose a non-probabilistic theory of ind uctive rea­
soning [16, 17]. A non-probabilistic theory was sought
because inductive reasoning involves classifying propo­
sitions according to whether they are believed or dis­
believed and then changing this classification upon re­
ceiving further information. But classical probability
theory did not support such a classification: proposi­
tions are only graded by their probabilities and are not
classified into believed/ disbelieved/uncommitted.
Given this motivation, the properties of kappa calculus
can be justified without having to appeal to a proba­
bilistic interpretation, which is how the calculus was
argued for in [16]. There, a state of belief is repre­
sented by a ranking K that maps propositions into the
class of ordinals such that
1. K(true) = 0,
2. K(a V {3) =min(K(a), ��:({3)).
A rule was also given for conditioning a state of belief
K on evidence J..L:
��:(a I p.):::: K(a Ap.)- K(J.L).
According to kappa calculus, a proposition a is be­
lieved to degree s if K(..,a) = s; is disbelieved to degree
s if K(a) = s; and is uncommitted if K(a) =,..;(-,a) =0.
Moreover, the streng ths of these beliefs decide which of
them are retracted when accommodating a disbelieved
evidence.
Kappa calculus then offers a framework for reasoning
with defeasible beliefs, where the kappa rankings play
the role of default priorities [10, 11]. But the calculus
is analogous to probability calculus in the sense that
it provides a similar machinery: a definition of a state
of belief and a definition of conditionalization for ac­
commodating evidence. This correspondence should
not be surprising, however, given the symbolic gener­
alization of probability theory in [4], which provides
definitions for abstract states of belief and abstract
conditionalization that subsume both probability and
kappa calculi (see [14] also for a generalization of belief
functions that subsumes kappa rankings).
3

Kappas and probabilities

Although Spohn has motivated kappa calculus as a
theory of belief change, Spohn also noted the con­
nection between kappas and nonstandard probabilities

On the Relation between Kappa Calculus and Probabilistic Reasoning

[16, 17]. The purpose was mainly to explain the sym­
metry between properties of kappa calculus and laws of
probability theory. In particular, Spohn suggested in
[16] a mapping from probability distributions to kappa
rankings that justifies the properties of kappa calculus.
He proposed mapping each probability Pr(a I {3) into
a ranking k such that Pr(o: I {3)/<k is finite but not in­
finitesimal for an infinitesimal f. Spohn then showed
that we get the following:
1. ��:(a V ;3) =min(��:( a), ��::(/3)),
2. ��:(a I /3) =��:(a: A/3)- ��::(/3),
which are the basic properties of kappa rankings. This
result provides an interpretation of kappa rankings
as order-of-magnitude approximations of probabilities
through the following relation:

f<pjfk�1,
which is equivalent to fk+l < p �

147

(1)
fk.

This connection between kappa rankings and proba­
bilities is of great theoretical interest. For example,
its role has been explored at length in providing prob­
abilistic semantics to defeasible if-then rules that are
crucial to nonmonotonic reasoning [8]. But the con­
nection between kappas and probabilities is also im­
portant from a purely probabilistic sense. That is,
a key concern of Bayesian practitioners, for example,
is to continue to enjoy the merits of Bayesian tech­
niques while committing as little as possible to point
probabilities. The view of kappa rankings as order­
of-magnitudes probabilities is one way to satisfy this
need. That is, instead of providing point probabilities,
one provides kappa rankings. In fact, the role of such a
connection goes beyond the knowledge elicitation pro­
cess to at least two other areas:
1. Given probabilities that result from answering a
query, we can map these probabilities into kappa

rankings before we present them to experts or be­
fore we use them as inputs to other reasoning pro­
cesses such as decision making.
2. Given a set of probabilities to be computed with,
we can map these into kappas and then use kappa­
specific algorithms for the computation. This step
is significant if kappa-specific algorithms turn out
to be more efficient than probabilistic ones, a hope
that is being backed by recent results [13, 9].
One should emphasize though that the above connec­
tion between kappas and probabilities rests on assum­
ing that f is infinitesimal. Given a probability distri­
bution, for example, the following two computations
will yield the same results when an infinitesimal f is
used:
(C1) Computing posterior probabilities using probabil­
ity calculus and then abstracting them into kappa
rankings.
(C2) Abstracting probabilities into kappa rankings and
then computing posterior kappa rankings using
kappa calculus.
But unless probabilities are arbitrarily high or low,
computations C1 and C2 will be equal in a trivial
sense. For example, if all probabilities are k nown to
be between .05 and .95, the mapping of Equation 1
will produce a zero kappa for each given probability.
This means that the resulting kappa distribution will
be trivial; all it says is that everything is possible and
that nothing is believed or disbelieved.
Therefore, we are constrained in practice to select a
noninfinitesimal E to use in Equation 1. There will al­
ways be tension between how close the value of t is
to zero and how close the results of computations C1
and C2 will be. On one extreme, f is very close to
zero and the results of Cl equal those of C2 but pos­
sibly in a trivial sense because the generated kappa

rankings may have lost most of the probabilistic infor­
mation. On the other extreme, < is not close to zero,
the resulting kappa rankings are not trivial, but the
results could be different from those obtained using
probability calculus. The experiments in the next sec­
tion will assess the discrepancies between the results of
kappa calculus and those of probability calculus when
< is not infinitesimal, using two different measures of
discrepancy. Section 5 will then offer a formal analy­
sis of these results by identifying cases in which such
discrepancies are expected.

Experimental results

To empirically study the connection between kappa
calculus and probabilistic reasoning in those instances
were <. is not infinitesimal, we conducted a set of exper­
iments with different values of<. and different evidence.
These experiments were performed on a probabilistic
causal network for diagnostic reasoning about faults
in a car. The network is depicted in Figure 1.1 Each
experiment involved setting the value of<, providing
observations in the form of evidence, evaluating the
probabilistic network using probability calculus, trans­
lating the probabilistic network into a kappa network
using the procedure in Figure 2, and then evaluating
the resulting kappa network using kappa calculus.
We conducted three sets of experiments for < = 0.2,
c:: = 0.02, and<= 0.002. We report below (see Tables 1
and 2) on the most representative results of the simi­
larities and differences between kappa and probabilis­
tic inference. The observables where engine-start,
gas-gauge, lights, and engine-turn-over, while
the faults where alternator, battery, fuel-pump,
gas, plugs and starter. The value of engine-start
was always set to BO.
To assess the discrepancies between kappa and proba­
bility computations, we used the following two criteria:

1. Ordering of faults:

In Table 1 we order the faults
according to their corresponding probabilities and
kappas. The table contains eight "runs", where a
run is defined by an instantiation of the evidence.
The first line in each run corresponds to the or­
dering of faults according to their probabilistic de-

1This network was obtained from the Bayesian group at
Microsoft Research.

2.

Degrees of Belief" In Table 2 we compare the
probabilities of faults to their kappa rankings
by transforming the posterior probabilities into
kappa rankings following the procedure in Fig­
ure 2 and using <. = 0.02.

The first criterion provides a practical measure of the
correspondence between kappa and probabilistic infer­
ence when the kappa network is generated automati­
cally from a probabilistic one. The second criterion is
intended to compare the results of computations Cl
and C2 in Section 3 when <. is not infinitesimal.
All of the experiments reported here were conducted
using CNETS [3]: an experimental tool for represent­
ing and reasoning with generalized causal networks [2],
which include kappa and probabilistic causal networks
as special instances.
We have the following observations about the reported
results:
Ordering of the faults

W hen c:: = 0.2, the ordering of faults according to prob­
abilities and kappas is the same in all the runs, pro­
vided we break ties in a particular manner. Ties in the
kappa case are expected given that they represent an
abstraction of the real probabilistic value.
When c:: = 0.02, the results are also very close, except
that the most likely fault and the second most likely
fault are inverted in runs 2,4 and 6. The discrepancies
in these runs are due to the same reason: loss of in­
formation due to the kappa abstraction. In particular,
the matrix quantifying engine-starts contains four
rows in which the kappa of engine-starts and the
kappa of its negation are both zeros. That is, there
are four rows in which the matrix does not commit
to whether engine-starts is believed or disbelieved.
But when<. = 0.2, the matrix of engine-starts com­
mits to whether engine-starts is believed or disbe­
lieved in each row.
Degrees of belief in faults

Note that probabilities and kappas disagree more no­
ticeably in belief strengths than in the ordering of
faults. Kappas are generally much more committed
to assign stronger beliefs to the possible existence of
faults than probability. This property is illustrated in
Figures 4, 5, and 6, where kappa beliefs are sharp and
linear. These figures will be discussed in more detail
in Section 5.
The disagreement of belief strength in Table 2
prompted the formal analysis in Section 5.
We
basically identified two causal structures, a chain
and a fork - see Figure 3.
The chain struc­
ture was motivated by the discrepancies on the de-

It is important to point out that even though the
strength of belief between probabilities and kappas
does not always coincide, the most plausible faults do
agree. This suggests that the precise numbers may not
be relevant if we dim them for the purposes of optimal
recommendations regarding repair and actions.

on how far X; is from X 1. In kappa calculus, however,
we get a different behavior. That is, if we transform
the previous probabilistic chain to a kappa chain using
t = 0.2, we get the quantification: !i:[xiJ = K[xiJ = 0,
K[x;-lxi-d = 1 and !i:[xilx;-_Jl = 1. Moreover, after
observing that X1 is true, each following X; will be
believed true but with the same strength. That is,
the strength of belief is independent of how far xi is
from X1, contrary to the probabilistic case. Figure 4
shows the difference between kappa and probability
calculi with respect to the previous quantification of
the chain.

In general though, the propagation of belief from vari­
able X1 to variable X1 in such a network is governed
probabilistically by the following equation:

grees of belief in the subnetwork involving the nodes

The fork structure was motivated by the discrepan­
cies involving the subnetwork composed of the nodes

gas-gauge.

Formal Analysis

The discrepancies we obtained in the previous experi­
ments prompted the characterization of network con­
figurations on which the use of kappa calculus leads to
different results from probability calculus. In partic­
ular, we have identified two network structures where
we can characterize such a discrepancy and analyze
it intuitively. The first structure is that of a chain
of variables and is discussed in Section 5.1. The sec­
ond structure is that of a fork and is discussed in Sec­
tion 5.2.
5.1

Propagation in chains

Consider the chain in Figure 3a, where all variables
are assumed to be binary with values xi (true) and
x;- (false). Suppose that the causal links are quantified
as follows: Pr[xj] = 0.5, Pr[xt I X;�1] = 0.8, and
P[xi I xj""_1] = 0.2. Suppose further that we observe
variable X1 to be true. What can we conclude about
the probability that a descendant X; is true?
According to probability calculus, the probability that
any descendant xi is true will increase after observing
that X 1 is true. Moreover, such increase will depend

The kappa ranking corresponding to the result of
Equation 2 should be equal to the result of Equation 3
when kappa rankings are generated using an infinites­
imal t. In the experiments of Section 4, however, we
used real valued t, which prompted the difference in
the degrees of belief in Table 2.
5.2

Fusion in forks

Consider the network in Figure 3b, where all vari­
ables are also assumed to be binary. Suppose that the
causal links are quantified as follows: P[y+] = 0.04,
P[xtly+] = 0.8 and P[xtiY-] = 0.2. Suppose further
that we observe variables X1 through Xi to be true.
What can we conclude about the probability that Xn
is true?

In the probabilistic case, we expect that the previous
evidence will increase the probability in Xn being true.
After all, the evidence increases the belief in Y being
true, which translates into an increase in the proba­
bility of Xn being true. Moreover, the increase in the
probability of Xn depends on the number of observed
variables X11 ... , X;. That is, the bigger i is, the big­
ger the increase in the probability of Xn. Figure 5
supports this intuition by plotting the increase for a

is affected by both the strength of y+ 's causal effect
on x t and by the strength of believing in y+. But the
strength of believing in y+ will be relevant only as long
as it is no stronger than the causal effect. Once the
belief in y+ exceeds the strength of this causal effect,
its exact value does not matter:

In the kappa case, however, observing the truth of ef­
fects X 1, . . , X; changes the belief in Xn but in a dif­
.

ferent manner as depicted in Figure 6. That is, choos­
ing the quantification: K[y+] = 5, K[xi IY+] = 1 and
K[x t IY-] = 1 leads to the following. First, if the num­
ber of observations is less than five, Xn is believed
to be false. In case of six observations, Xn is neither
believed true nor false. But as we collect more observa­

of this belief is not affected by the number of further
observations.

which leads to K[x�] = min(l + K[y+], K[y-]) and
K[x t ] = min(K[y+J, 1 + K(y-]) in the above quantifica­
tion. That is, if y+ is unknown, then xt is unknown;
if y+ is believed to degree 1, xt is believed to degree 1;
if y+ is believed to degree 2, xt is believed to degree
1; and so on. Now, as we obtain more observations
about the effects of Y, our belief in it increases, but
that does not affect the belief in Xn as shown above.

The reason for this behavior stems from the following
observation about kappa calculus. The belief in x t

one must first provide answers to a number of ques­

realm of probability theory, the properties of which

retain strong inferences. But our study also suggests
that more needs to be said about when key inferences
are retained.
The discrepancies obtained in inferences using proba­
bilistic methods and kappa calculus should not be too
surprising. Kappa calculus was proposed initially as a
calculus for defeasible reasoning in which kappa rank­
ings are interpreted as default priorities. As such, the
calculus has been argued for convincingly in (16], has

been shown to subsume many of the proposed calculi
for defeasible reasoning in [6, 8], and has also con­
tributed to the formalization of belief revision patterns
that were not accounted for in the belief revision litcalculus, therefore, seems to be very
defeasible reasoning perspective and
the inferences it leads to seem to be well justified. The
discrepancies with probability calculus, and their relation, can then be explained as follows. Kappa calcu-

as new evidence on its sibling nodes is gathered. In
contrast, the propagation of beliefs in the case of the
kappa case will be abrupt and sharp.

In this paper, we attempted to answer some of the
above questions by (1) proposing a concrete mapping
from probabilities to kappa rankings that does not re­
quire probabilities to be infinitesimal; (2) conducting
an empirical study to assess the proposed mapping and
to illustrate the expressiveness of kappa models in cap­
turing diagnostic information; (3) providing some for­
mal analysis of the connection between certain classes
of probabilistic and kappa causal networks. The basic
conclusion we have reached is that one may abstract
a probabilistic network into a kappa network and still

the information represented by the original probabilis­

Discussion

The use of probabilistic causal networks in diagnosis
applications has become very common in recent years.
One obstacle in this process, however, is the need to
quantify causal relationships using point probabilities.
Most often, probabilities are hard to assess and when
they are provided, they seem to be too detailed for
the reasoning tasks they are used to support. One
possibility for simplifying this process is to quantify
causal relationships using kappa rankings, thus indue-

Ius as a method for defeasible reasoning manipulates
prioritized beliefs, which can be extracted from probabilistic information as suggested in Section 3. Yet,
default priorities are less informative and capture less
information than probabilities. Nevertheless, people
seem to perform this kind of abstraction all the time,
in spite of the possible loss of information. Most of
our beliefs are probabilistic in nature but they get
abstracted into default assumptions for various rea­
sons, such as communicating them to others, index­
ing them efficiently, and simplifying their assessments.
Thus, although the inferences made by kappa calcu­
lus can be well justified from the perspective of "plain
beliefs" and "defeasible reasoning" , they can disagree
with probabilistic inferences.

The work in this paper takes the first steps towards

On the Relation between Kappa Calculus and Probabilistic Reasoning

answering questions of a bigger scope such as: When
should we abstract probabilities into kappa rankings;
for what purpose; and for what cost/gain? In this
regard, we intend to continue this project in two di�
rections. The first one concerns the process of de�
cision making. The fact that the orders of faults
were very similar in both probabilities and kappas
suggests that the recommendations for repair should
also be very similar. We intend to conduct a similar
study to compare a probabilistic and a kappa decision
making approach. The second direction concerns the
computational value of abstracting probabilities into
kappa rankings. The behavior of kappas in chains and
forks suggest that the notion of belief acceptance in
kappa calculus may yield a notion of weak indepen�
dence where belief in a node may be enough to render
other nodes independent in the network. 2 Our hope is
that this property will translate into new algorithms
with definite computational gains.
