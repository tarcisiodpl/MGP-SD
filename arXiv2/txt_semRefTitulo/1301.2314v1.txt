Sensitivity analysis of a real-life probabilistic network
tends to result in a huge amount of data. For example, for a
real-life network in the field of oncology, comprising some

Introduction

The numerical parameters for a probabilistic network are
generally estimated from statistical data or assessed by hu­
man experts in the domain of application. As a result of
incompleteness of data and partial knowledge of the do­
main, the assessments obtained inevitably are inaccurate.
Since the outcome of a probabilistic network is built upon
these assessments, it may be sensitive to the inaccuracies
involved and, as a result, may even be unreliable.
The reliability of the outcome of a probabilistic network
can be evaluated by subjecting the network to a

analysis.

an

analysis has to be performed a number of times. For our

sensitivity

In general, sensitivity analysis of a mathematical

model amounts to investigating the effects of inaccuracies
in the model's parameters by systematically varying the
values of these parameters [1]. For a probabilistic network,
sensitivity analysis amounts to varying the assessments for
one or more of its numerical parameters and investigating
the effects on, for example, a probability of interest [2].

network, for example, we conducted over 150 analyses in­
volving data from real patients. For extracting relevant in­
formation from the data thus generated, effective methods
are called for that allow for (automatically) identifying pa­
rameters that are quite influential upon variation.

These

parameters should be selected for further investigation as

the inaccuracies in their assessments are likely to affect the
network's outcome.
In her work on sensitivity analysis of probabilistic net­
works, K. Blackmond Laskey introduced the concept of

sensitivity value [4]. The concept builds upon the (par­
derivative of the sensitivity function that expresses the

network's probability of interest in terms of a parameter

under study: the sensitivity value is the absolute value of
this derivative at the original assessment for the parame­
ter. As currently available algorithms for sensitivity anal­
ysis of probabilistic networks yield the probability of in-

terest explicitly as a fimction of the parameter under study,
the derivative and its associated sensitivity value are read­
ily determined. In this paper, we study the derivatives of
sensitivity functions and show how sensitivity values can
be used for selecting parameters for further investigation.
In many real-life applications of probabilistic networks, the
outcome of interest is not a probability, but rather the most
likely value of a variable of interest. In a medical applica­
tion, for example, the outcome of interest may be the most
likely diagnosis given a patient's symptoms and signs. For
this type of outcome, the derivative of a sensitivity fimction
and its associated sensitivity value are no longer appropri­
ate for establishing the effect of parameter variation: a pa­
rameter with a large sensitivity value may upon variation
not induce a change in the most likely outcome, while a
parameter with a small sensitivity value may induce such a
change for just a small deviation from its original assess­
ment. To describe the sensitivities of this type of outcome,
we introduce the concept of admissible deviation. This
concept captures the extent to which a parameter can be
varied without inducing a change in the most likely value
for the variable of interest. We show how the concept of
admissible deviation can be used for selecting parameters.
The various concepts introduced in this paper will be illus­
trated by means of a sensitivity analysis of a moderately­
sized real-life probabilistic network in the field of oncol­
ogy. We would like to note that this network exhibits con­
siderable sensitivity to parameter variation. This observa­
tion contradicts earlier suggestions that probabilistic net­
works are highly insensitive to inaccuracies in the assess­
ments for their parameters I 5, 6]. Our results now seem
to indicate that the sensitivities exhibited by probabilistic
networks may vary from application to application.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we provide
some preliminaries on sensitivity analysis of probabilistic
networks. In Section 3, we briefly discuss the oesophagus
network with which we will illustrate the concepts intro­
duced in the subsequent sections. In Section 4, we study
the derivative of a sensitivity function and its associated
sensitivity value. In Section 5, we introduce the concept
of admissible deviation and discuss its use for extracting
relevant information from sensitivity data. The paper ends
with our conclusions and directions for further research in
Section 6.

Preliminaries

Sensitivity analysis of a probabilistic network amounts to
establishing, for each of the network's numerical parame­
ters, the sensitivityfunction that expresses the probability of
interest in terms of the parameter under study. In the sequel,
we denote the probability of interest by Pr( A a I e ) , or
Pr(a I e) for short, where a is a specific value of the vari­
able A of interest and e denotes the available evidence. The
=

531

network's parameters are denoted by x = p(bi I 1r), where
bi is a value of a variable B and 1r is a combination of val­
ues for the parents of B. We write !Pr(ale)(x) to denote the
sensitivity function that expresses the probability Pr(a I e )
in terms of the parameter x; for ease of exposition, we will

often omit or abbreviate the subscript for the fimction sym­
bol f, as long as ambiguity cannot occur.

Upon varying a single parameter x p(bi I 1r) in a prob­
abilistic network, the other parameters p(bi I 1r), j =f:. i,
specified for the variable B need to be co-varied. Each pa­
rameter p(bi I 1r) can thus be seen as a function gj(x) of
the parameter x under study. In the sequel, we assume that
the parameters p(bj I 1r) are co-varied in such a way that
their mutual proportional relationship is kept constant, that
is, a parameter p(bi I 1r ) is co-varied according to
=

if j

=

i

otherwise
for p(bi I 1r) < 1.
Under the assumption of co-variation described above, a
sensitivity function f(x) is a quotient of two functions that
are linear in the parameter x under study [2, 7]; more for­
mally, the function takes the form

f(x)

x+ b
c·x+ d

=a ·

where the constants a, b, c, and d are built from the assess­
ments for the numerical parameters that are not being var­
ied. From this property we have that a sensitivity function
is characterised by at most three constants. These constants
can be feasibly determined from the network, for example
by computing the probability of interest for a small num­
ber of values for the parameter under study and solving the
resulting system of equations [2]. An even more efficient
algorithm that is closely related to junction-tree propaga­
tion, is available from [3].

The oesophagus network

The oesophagus network that will be used to illustrate con­
cepts throughout this paper, is a real-life probabilistic net­
work for the staging of oesophageal cancer. The network
was constructed and refined with the help of two experts
in gastrointestinal oncology from the Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, and is destined for
use in clinical practice [8].
As a consequence of a lesion of the oesophageal wall, a
tumour may develop in a patient's oesophagus. The char­
acteristics of the tumour, such as its location in the oe­
sophagus and its macroscopic shape, influence the tumour's
prospective growth. The tu±nour typically invades the oe­
sophageal wall and upon further growth may affect neigh-

bouring organs. In time, the tumour may give rise to lym­
phatic and haematogenous metastases. The characteristics,
depth of invasion, and extent of metastasis of the cancer
largely influence a patient's life expectancy and are indica­
tive of the effects and complications to be expected from
the various therapeutic alternatives. The three factors are
summarised in the stage of the cancer, which can be ei­
ther I, IIA, liB, III, IVA or !VB, in the order of progressive
disease. To establish the stage of a patient's cancer, typi­
cally a number of diagnostic tests are performed, ranging
from biopsies of the primary tumour to gastroscopic and
endosonographic examinations of the oesophagus.
The oesophagus network is depicted in Figure 1. It cur­
rently includes4 2 variables. The number of values per vari­
able ranges between two and six, with an average of 3.4.
The number of incoming arcs per variable ranges between
zero and three with an average of 1.7; the average number
of outgoing arcs is 2.5, with a minimum of zero and a maxi­
mum of 11. For the network, a total of932 probabilities are
specified. The variable with the largest number of proba­
bilities, 144 , models the stage of the cancer; this variable is
deterministic. The largest number of probabilities specified
for a non-deterministic variable is 80.
Building upon the concepts outlined in Section 2, we per­
formed a sensitivity analysis of the oesophagus network.
We took the probability of a specific stage for the proba­
bility of interest. As six different stages are defined, we
performed six separate analyses, each time focusing on an-

other stage. Of the prior network, that is, the network with­
out any evidence entered, we found 206 of the 932 param­
eters to be influential upon variation. For these parameters,
the analyses yielded a total of 1236 sensitivity functions
with two or three constants each. Because a network's
sensitivities typically change with evidence, we repeated
the analysis with data entered from 156 patients diagnosed
with oesophageal cancer. The number of data entered per
patient ranged between 6 and 21, with an average of 14 .8.
The parameters that we found to be influential upon vari­
ation differed between patients. The number of influential
parameters also differed considerably and was found to be
as high as 826.

The derivative and its sensitivity value

For extracting relevant information from the huge amount
of sensitivity data that is typically generated from a proba­
bilistic network, effective methods are needed. In this sec­
tion, we discuss a method for this purpose that is based
on the derivative of a sensitivity function and its associated
sensitivity value. This method provides for selecting pa­
rameters that upon variation have a large effect on a proba­
bility of interest. In the next section, we introduce another
method, based on the concept of admissible deviation, that
focuses on the most likely value of a variable of interest.
In Section 2, we argued that the sensitivity of a probability
of interest to variation of a parameter x can be expressed as

the probability of interest. If the assessment would have

that even minor deviations would have had a considerable

Based upon the concept of sensitivity value, we might con­
clude that the parameters for whose assessments the sensi­
tivity values are the largest, are the most likely to be quite
influential upon variation and therefore should be selected
for further investigation. Sensitivity values, however, pro­
vide insight in the effect of small deviations only from a
parameter's assessment. When larger deviations are con­
sidered, the quality of the value

sessment is therefore no guarantee that the probability of
interest is hardly affected by variation of this parameter.
From our discussion of the sensitivity function shown in
Figure 2, we have that the quality of a sensitivity value
for indicating the effect of parameter variation decreases
as the parameter's original assessment lies closer to the x­
coordinate of the function's

Therefore, to de­

"shoulder".

cide whether or not the probability of interest is likely to
be affected by inaccuracies in the assessment for a specific
parameter, we should consider not just the associated sen­
sitivity value but also the distance of the assessment to the
x-coordinate of the shoulder of the sensitivity function. We
define the concept of shoulder more formally.
A sensitivity function is either a linear function or a hyper­
bola. For

c = 0,

for example, the sensitivity function is

provide additional insight into the sensitivity of a proba­
bilistic network's outcome to inaccuracies in its parame­
ters. We would like to note that the use of admissible de­
viations is especially of interest when decisions are to be
based on the most likely value of a variable of interest [10].
