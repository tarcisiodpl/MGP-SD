potential actions of other agents.

When agents devise plans for execution in the
real world, they face two important forms of
uncertainty: they can never have complete
knowledge about the state of the world, and they
do not have complete control, as the effects of
their actions are uncertain. While most classical
planning methods avoid explicit uncertainty
reasoning, we believe that uncertainty should be
explicitly represented and reasoned about. We
develop a probabilistic representation for states
and actions, based on belief networks. We
define conditional belief nets (CBNs) to capture
the probabilistic dependency of the effects of an
action upon the state of the world. We also use a
CBN to represent the intrinsic relationships
among entities in the environment, which persist
from state to state. We present a simple
projection algorithm to construct the belief
network of the state succeeding an action, using
the environment CBN model to infer indirect
effects. We discuss how the qualitative aspects of
belief networks and CBNs make them
appropriate for the various stages of the problem
solving process, from model construction to the
design of planning algorithms.

INTRODUCTION

Real-world planning poses special challenges which early
planning systems did not fully confront. Typically, the
domain models upon which real-world planners rely
reflect incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the
domain's ontology, the objects and events used to
describe domain states, and its dynamics, the underlying
principles that define object-event relationships in the
domain. Due to such inherent limitations of scope and
accuracy, real-world planners must cope with substantive
uncertainty as they reason about actions and formulate
plans. These planners must deal adequately with
uncertainty about past, present, and future states of the
world including uncertainty about the occurrence of
particular events in the domain. These challenges are
exacerbated by the reliance on imperfect sensor

Early planning systems, e.g., S1RIPS (Fikes and Nilsson,
1971) and NOAH (Sacerdoti, 1975) presumed availability
of a complete, accurate domain representation and,
consequently, produced plans that would readily fail as a
result of inadequacies in the domain model. As planning
researchers began to address the challenges of uncertainty
several approaches emerged, including replanning
(Wilkins, 1988), interleaved planning and execution
(McDermott, 1978; Georgeff and Lansky, 1987), reactive
planning (Brooks, 1986; Kae1bling, 1987; Schoppers,
1987), and conditional planning (Warren, 1976; Peot and
Smith, 1992). These approaches reduce the negative
impact of uncertainty on the quality of plans, but none
represents and reasons about uncertainty explicitly.
So far, several attempts have been made to integrate
uncertainty representation and reasoning techniques into
planning. Markov chains are used by Christiansen and
Goldberg ( 1990) and by Dean et al. (1993) to depict a
sequence of possible actions. Kanazawa and Dean (1989)
use influence diagrams similarly to Markov chains,
without exploiting their structure. Several efforts focus
on the design of specialized projection algorithms (e.g.,
Dean and Kanazawa, 1989; Hanks, 1990; Drummond and
Bresina, 1990).
Recently, some probabilistic and
decision-theoretic systems have been implemented
(Kushmerick et al, 1994; Goldman and Boddy, 1994;
Haddawy and Suwandi, 1994). Most of these approaches
represent uncertainty probabilistically.
However,
Wellman (1990a) uses qualitative probabilistic networks,
while Chrisman (1992) rejects Bayesian probability in
favor of Belief Functions.
Some of these probabilistic approaches contrast strongly
with the more classical AI approaches. While it is agreed
that transition matrices provide a complete representation
for actions' effects and readily support probabilistic
temporal projection, this representation poses extreme
challenges. On the practical side, a daunting amount of
assessment may be needed to construct a complete
Markov transition matrix, and inference with matrices
cannot easily support queries about specific properties of
states. Perhaps more importantly, it remains unclear how,

conventional planning techniques.
In contrast, our approach to planning under uncertainty
aims to incorporate a suitable treatment of uncertainty

arcs may be reversed without affecting the rest of the
network (e.g., between object size and weight). In fact,

any arc can be reversed, with possible modifications to the
rest of the network (Shachter, 1986). Third, a node may
be a deterministic function of its predecessors (e.g., the
alarm is activated if, and only if at least one sensor is on),

specified,

3 REPRESENTING ACTIONS

P(eff(A) I qual(A)) can be considered as the

compact model of the action.

World state models describe relationships within a
specific state. We now model actions taking the standard

view of actions as transitions between consecutive states.
Thus, given the state of the world preceding the action, an
action model defines probabilistic constraints on the state
succeeding the action. In other words, an action could be
described by a conditional probability distribution for the
state succeeding the action given t11e state preceding the
action. We do not wish, however, to require that every
action be specified by a full probability matrix, for

reasons stated above. We seek a compact representation
that states only the intrinsic properties of an action.
Before presenting the formal definition, consider the
action of our robot picking up the object. The robot is
uncertain whether the object will end up in its g rasp.
Thus, one probabilistic effect of the action is object
location-the object may remain in t11e same location (if it
is too heavy to lift, say), the object may fall to the floor (if
its size makes it awkward to carry to the loading bay), or,

hopefully, the object's new location may indeed be tile
robot's bay. Another uncertain effect is the activation of
the alarm by triggering one of the sensors.

As actions are defined in terms of conditional probability

representation, we now define a variant of a belief
network-a

display a conditional distribution.

Let P(E I Q) be a conditional probability
E given Q (where Q and E are disjoint sets
of distinctions). Let B be a directed acyclic graph
(Q, E R), where QuE is a set of nodes and Rb;(Qu£ )xE
is a set of directed arcs. Let (Q, e1,...,en) be a node
ordering consistent with B and let 1t(e) be the set of
parents of node e in B. We say that B is a conditional
belief network ( CBN) for P(E I Q) if for every node e;EE,

We modify slightly the projection algorithm from the

derive the indirect effects of an action (instead of on the
network of the preceding state). The modified algorithm

Note that the network in figure 5 t( he succeeding state)
has a different structure from the one in figure 1 (the
preceding state).
In particular, object size became
probabilistically relevant to object location and motion
sensor,and similarly,information about the sound sensor
is relevant to object location. Thus,the action introduced
in formational relationships between entities in the
domain.
There is a potential problem with our very flexible
approach. S uppose next, our robot performs an action
that directly affectsthe size ofthe object e
( .g.,cutting it
into half).
Our projection algorithm would infer an
indirect effect on both the object location and the motion
sensor. Similarly,the robot may now have a silent way to
move the object,so a subsequent change in object location
need not necessarily have the status of the soundsensor as
an indirect effect. The main point here is that these
informational relations that are introduced by the action
do not necessarily persist from one state to another. fI a
subsequent action affects a distinction dthat is associated
with another distinction e, the new value ds in the
succeeding state need not be related

In general,the algorithm as outlined above is sensitive to
the direction of the arcs in h
t e network of the preceding
state. Since every arc can be reversed employing the
graphical equivalent ofBayes' rule S
( hachter, 1986),our
projection algorithm may yield different results given
different graphical representations of the preceding state.
These difficulties should not come as asurprise. As Pearl
(1994)notes: "While a
( probability distribution) tells us
everything about responding to new observations,it tells
us close to nothing about responding to external actions"
(p. 204). Thus,the model of the preceding statecannot be
sufficient. Additional assumptions must be made.
To resolve the problem we tumback to the Environment
Model. Recall that the Environment Model representsthe

For the robot's example above,the combined network for
the pickup action would be the same with the modified
algorithm (with the Environment Model in figure 3as an
additional input) as it was with the original algorithm.
That is, the modified algorithm projects the same
succeeding state as in figure 5. However,if a subsequent
action changes the location of the object independent of
the sensors, the modified algorithm would not infer the
sound sensor (and the rest of the alarm system) as indirect
effects.
They would retain their values from the
preceding state.
Without imposing any restriction on action models, a

actions and relations in the Environment Model. fI a

PROPERTIES OF ACTION MODELS

We now briefly discuss the restriction we imposed on
actions to affect only free distinctions in the Environment

the

classical

action­

representation schemes such as STRIPS (Fikes and
Nilsson, 1971) and the situation calculus (McCarthy and
Hayes, 1969). Like STRIPS, our action models depict the

relationships among preconditions and effects, though we

relate them probabilistically.

STRIPS suffers from the

need to explicitly specify the truth value of all formulas

that could possibly be affected by an operator. Attempts

to eliminate the problem (Wilkins, 1988) allow a set of
basic formulas to appear in add/delete lists, from which all
other formulas are calculated.

Our approach is similar:

action models may affect only the free distinctions in the

environment, while all other distinctions are conditioned
upon the free ones, and cannot be affected directly.

Any scheme similar to the situation calculus suffers from
the frame problem.

Our solution to the extended

prediction problem is similar to STRIPS': we assume
persistence of whatever is not affected, but we handle

qualification problem by acknowledging that a model can
never exhaust the qualifying distinctions in the real world,

Our work on this scheme continues. We believe that the
framework will prove appropriate for decision-theoretic
planning, whereby maximum expected value is the
criterion for the optimality of plans. We are now at work
to introduce levels of abstraction into this representation
scheme, and to devise a hierarchical planning algorithm
for this approach.
