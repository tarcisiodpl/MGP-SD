elasticity is the sum of local contributions that arise from a discrepancy between the actual metric and the reference metric. In contrast,
the modeling of defects in solids has traditionally involved extra structure on the material manifold, notably torsion to quantify the density
of dislocations and non-metricity to represent the density of point defects. We show that all the classical defects can be described within
the framework of classical elasticity using tensor fields that only assume a metric structure. Specifically, bodies with singular defects can
be viewed as affine manifolds; both disclinations and dislocations are
captured by the monodromy that maps curves that surround the loci
of the defects into affine transformations. Finally, we show that two
dimensional defects with trivial monodromy are purely local in the
sense that if we remove from the manifold a compact set that contains
the locus of the defect, the punctured manifold can be isometrically
embedded in Euclidean space.

Introduction
Background

The study of defects in solids and the mechanical properties of solids with
imperfections is a longstanding theme in material science. There exists a
wide range of prototypical crystalline defects, among which are dislocations,
disclinations, and point defects. An influential dogma since the 1950s has
been to describe defects in solids using differential geometric tools. That is,
intermolecular effects are smeared out and the defective solid is modeled as
a smooth differentiable manifold equipped with a structure that captures its
intrinsic geometry, and notably the defects.
The pioneers in the adoption of geometric fields to describe defects in
crystalline solids were Kondo [16], Bilby et al. [4, 5], and Kröner [17]. Their
approach was motivated by the common practice in crystallography—Burgers
circuits, that are based on discrete steps with respect to a local crystalline
structure, and the identification of defects with a discrepancy between closed
loops in real space and closed loops in the discrete crystallographic space.
The theory of Kondo and Bilby connects this crystallographic practice to
a general theory of continuously dislocated crystals. Its central pillar is a
notion of parallelism—it is assumed that one knows how to translate vectors
in parallel from one point in the body to another. This premise reflects
2

the existence of an underlying lattice, and parallelism is defined such that
the components of the translated vector remain constant with respect to the
lattice axes.
For defects of dislocation-type, Bilby et al. assume a property of distant
parallelism, which amounts to the assumption that a lattice can be defined
globally far enough from the locus of the defect, so that the parallel transport
of vectors with respect to this lattice is path-independent. Mathematically,
their assumption amounts to the postulation of a global frame field, which
automatically defines a connection with respect to which this frame field is
parallel. This connection is the main geometric structure used by Kondo and
Bilby et al. to describe the state of a dislocated crystal.
A relation between material properties and a material connection was
rigorously defined in Wang [25]. Wang’s point of view is that the mechanical properties of a solid are fully encoded in its constitutive relations. In
particular, these relations define a collection of symmetry-preserving maps
between tangent spaces at different points. Intuitively, this collection of maps
determines in what sense a material element at one point is the “same” as a
material elements at another point. Mathematically, this collection of maps
can be identified with a family of sections of the principal bundle of frame
fields. Each such section defines a connection. If the connection is independent of the chosen section, the material symmetries are said to be associated
with a material connection. As Wang shows, a material connection exists
only in the case of discrete symmetries.
Every connection carries two associated geometric fields—curvature and
torsion. A non-vanishing curvature implies that vectors transported in parallel along closed loops do not regain their initial value. For a connection that
admits a parallel frame field, the curvature is always zero, and the manifold
is then said to be flat. A non-vanishing torsion is associated with an asymmetry in the law of parallel transport, or with the failure of parallelograms
to be closed. Torsion has been traditionally associated with the presence of
non-zero Burgers vectors, and more specifically, as a measure for the density
of dislocations (see the recent paper of Ozakin and Yavari [22] for a modern
derivation of the relation between the two). Thus, a dislocated crystal is
commonly described as a manifold equipped with a connection that has zero
curvature but non-zero torsion, a manifold known as a Weitzenböck manifold.
Another thoroughly-studied type of defect is a disclination. Like dislocations, disclinations are detected by the parallel transport of vectors. If
dislocations are translational defects, disclinations are rotational defects. A
3

vector translated in parallel along a closed loop that surrounds a disclination
line does not return to its initial value. The geometric interpretation of this
effect is the presence of a non-zero curvature. There is in fact a close analogy
between dislocations and disclinations: dislocations are measured in terms of
a translational Burgers vector whereas disclinations are measured in terms of
an angular Franck vector. In a dislocated solid, torsion measures the Burgers
vector density, whereas in a disclinated body, curvature measures the density
of the Franck vector. See Romanov, Derezin and Zubov [7] and Yavari and
Goriely [27] for recent works on the modeling of disclinations in solids.
A third type of defect is a point defect. The two prototypical examples of a
point defect are a vacancy, in which material is removed and the resulting hole
is “welded”, and an intersticial, in which extra material is inserted at a point.
Point defects have also been described using differential geometric fields, and
in this context, Kröner introduced the notion of non-metricity [18]—a solid
with point defects is modeled as a manifold equipped with a connection and
a metric, but the connection is not compatible with the metric, i.e., parallel
transport does not preserve the Riemannian inner-product. See Katanaev
and Volovick [14], Miri and Rivier [21], and Yavari and Goriely [29] for more
recent work.
The description of combinations of the above mentioned defect types has
been addressed by several authors. In particular, Katanaev and Volovich
[14], consider all three defect types. Miri and Rivier [21] also consider different types of topological defects, and raise two questions that are especially
relevant to the present work: (i) can dislocations and disclinations co-exist?
and (ii) do dislocations and disclinations “survive” in amorphous solids where
there is no lattice to dislocate? Both questions will be addressed below.
Finally, we mention the recent series of papers by Yavari and Goriely
[28, 27, 29], which present a very comprehensive description of the Cartan
moving frame formalism, and its uses in the modeling of the three types
of defects. In addition to a systematic use of the Riemann-Cartan formalism to simplify calculations in both Riemannian and non-Riemannian manifolds, these papers make a distinctive contribution: for each type of defect
they solve specific yet representative examples, and calculate residual stresses
within the framework of nonlinear elasticity.

Outline of results

The present work is motivated by the recent growing interest in amorphous
materials that have a non-trivial intrinsic geometry. There is a wealth of
recent work on pattern formation in living tissues such as leaves [19], fungi
[8], flowers [11, 20], pines [6], seed pods [2], and isolated cells [1]. There is also
a growing literature on engineered soft materials, e.g., [15, 26]. These tissues
can be attributed a natural metric structure, and are essentially isotropic.
The renewed interest in amorphous materials endowed with a non-trivial
geometry leads us to reconsider whether there can be defects in a medium
that is inherently disordered. This is especially pressing in light of Wang’s
conclusion that a material connection can be defined unambiguously only
in the presence of discrete symmetries. Even before that, we should clarify
what makes a solid defect-free.
As our basic model for an isotropic defect-free elastic medium we take a
Riemannian manifold that can be embedded isometrically in three-dimensional
Euclidean space. Dislocations, disclinations and point defects are in a sense
“elementary defects”, in which the defect-free structure is destroyed in clearly
delineated regions (typically lines or points). This observation motivates the
definition of elementary defects in isotropic media. A body with singular defects is defined as a topological manifold X and a closed subspace D, which
we identify as the locus of the defect. Moreover, M = X \ D is a endowed
with a smooth structure and a Riemannian metric, such that each point of
M has a neighborhood that is defect-free in the above sense. Note that this
definition is in accordance with the concept of a defect proposed by Volterra
more than a century ago [24].
Our next step is to classify types of singular defects, and in particular,
connect this notion to the classical notions of dislocations, disclinations, and
point defects. Moreover, we address the question raised by Miri and Rivier
as to whether dislocations and disclinations can co-exist.
The differentiable manifold that consists of the body minus the locus of
the defect can be viewed as an affine manifold [3], i.e., a differentiable manifold whose local charts are related to each other by affine transformations. As
defects are of topological nature, this affine manifold often has a non-trivial
topology. One of the basic tools for studying the topology of a manifold is the
fundamental group, whose elements are the homotopy classes of closed loops.
In our context, the homotopy class describes how a closed curve goes around
the locus of the defect. For affine manifolds there is a well-known map from
5

the fundamental group to affine transformations of Euclidean space. This
map, which is a group homomorphism, is known as the monodromy [12].
As we will show, the monodromy encompasses both the notions of disclination and dislocation. The linear part of the affine transformation quantifies
disclination, whereas the translational part quantifies dislocation. While this
seems to imply, in response to the question raised by Miri and Rivier, that
dislocations and disclinations can co-exist, the actual answer is more subtle.
The subtlety arises from the necessity to choose a base point in defining the
fundamental group. Let us focus on a given homotopy class, and assume
the fundamental group is abelian.Then, taking into account the base-point
dependence, the linear part of the monodromy can be described by a tensor
field and the translation part can be described by a vector field. The tensor field describing the linear part is covariant constant. So, the essential
information is contained in the tensor’s value at a single point, which in the
context of defects, is essentially the classical Franck vector. In contrast, the
vector field describing the translation part of the monodromy is only covariant constant if the linear part is trivial. In the context of defects, this means
that a dislocation can be quantified by a Burgers vector, i.e., by a quantity
that depends on the properties of the defect but not on the point of reference,
only in the absence of disclinations.
The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we propose a definition for bodies with singular defects, and show that they can be viewed as
affine manifolds. In Section 3 we describe the monodromy of an affine manifold as a map from its fundamental group to affine transformations of its
tangent space. In particular, we relate the monodromy to disclinations and
dislocations. In Section 4 we analyze in this context the classical defects—
disclinations, screw dislocations, edge dislocations, higher-order defects, and
point defects. For each example we perform an explicit calculation of the
monodromy. Furthermore, we prove a general result for two-dimensional defects asserting that trivial monodromy implies a purely local defect. Finally,
our results are summarized and interpreted in Section 5.

Bodies with singular defects
Definitions

Our first step is to define what is a solid body with singular defects in a
manner that only relies on its metric, and does not depend on the presence
of a lattice structure, whether because there is no such structure or because
it does not affect the mechanical properties of the body. We start by defining what is a body free of defects. We formulate everything in arbitrary
dimension n; in most applications n = 3.
Definition 2.1 A defect-free body is a connected, oriented, n-dimensional
Riemannian manifold (M, g), possibly with boundary, that is globally flat,
i.e., there exists an isometric embedding,
f : M → Rn ,
where Rn is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, e; that is, g = f ? e.
A few words about notations: let f : M → N be a differentiable mapping
between two manifolds. Then df is a linear map T M → f ∗ T N, where f ∗ T N
is a vector bundle over M, with the fiber (f ∗ T N)p identified with the fiber
Tf (p) N. Because of this canonical identification, if F → M is a vector bundle
and Φ : f ∗ T N → F , then for p ∈ M and ξ ∈ Tf (p) N, we can unambiguously
apply Φ at p to ξ, denoting the result by Φp (ξ).
Let α ∈ Γ(N; T ∗ N) be a co-vector field on N. We denote by f ∗ α ∈
Γ(M; f ∗ T ∗ N) its pullback defined by,
p ∈ M,

(f ∗ α)p (v) = αf (p) (v),

v ∈ Tf (p) N,

where we applied the above canonical identification on the left hand side.
If we view α as a differential form rather than a section, then its pullback,
which is denoted by f ? α ∈ Γ(M; T ∗ M), is defined by
(f ? α)p (v) = αf (p) (dfp (v)),

p ∈ M,

v ∈ Tp M,

namely, f ? α = (f ∗ α) ◦ df . In this context, g = f ? e is defined by
g(u, v) = (f ∗ e)(df (u), df (v)),

u, v ∈ T M.

Having defined a defect-free body, we proceed to define a body with
singular defects.
7

Definition 2.2 A body with singular defects is a connected n-dimensional
topological manifold X and a (not-necessarily connected) closed subspace D ⊂
X (called the locus of the defect), such that M = X \ D is connected and oriented. Moreover, M is endowed with a smooth structure and a (reference)
metric g that is locally Euclidean: every point p ∈ M has an open neighborhood (Up , g|Up ) that embeds isometrically in (Rn , e). Finally, there do not
exist a smooth structure and Riemannian metric on X such that the inclusion
M ,→ X is an isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds.
The last condition in Definition 2.2 ensures the presence of a defect. In
some cases, there does exist a metric space structure on X such that the
inclusion M ,→ X is an isometric embedding of metric spaces.

2.2

The affine structure

A body with singular defects carries a natural affine structure. Let {(Uα , ϕα :
Uα → Rn )} be an atlas of orientation-preserving isometries (which by Definition 2.2 exists), namely,
g|Uα = ϕ?α e.
Let (Uα , ϕα ) and (Uβ , ϕβ ) be two local charts whose domains have a nonempty intersection, V = Uα ∩ Uβ . Then,
g|V = ϕ?α e|V = ϕ?β e|V ,
which implies that,
ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α : ϕα (V ) → ϕβ (V )
is an isometry between two open sets in Rn , namely a rigid transformation
of the form
A(x) = Lx + b,
where L ∈ SO(n) and b ∈ Rn . A manifold endowed with an atlas such that
all coordinate transforms are affine is called an affine manifold. Bodies with
singular defects form a subclass of affine manifolds in which all local chart
transformations are rigid transformations.
Any affine structure comes with a natural connection ∇M that is induced
from the standard connection ∇e in Euclidean space. Let (Uα , ϕα ) be a local
chart, then for X, Y ∈ Γ(Uα ; T Uα ) we define,
? e

∗ e
∇M
X Y = (ϕα ∇ )X Y = dϕα ((ϕα ∇ )X dϕα (Y )) .

8

Note that dϕα (Y ) ∈ Γ(Uα , ϕ∗α T Rn ), hence (ϕ∗α ∇e )X dϕα (Y ) ∈ Γ(Uα , ϕ∗α T Rn ),
∗
n
so that the action of dϕ−1
α : ϕα T R → T M is well-defined.
To show that the definition of the pullback connection is independent
of the chosen chart, i.e., coincides on overlapping charts, let ϕβ be another
chart with the same domain, and let ϕαβ = ϕα ◦ ϕ−1
β be the affine coordinate
transformation. Then
(ϕ?α ∇e )X Y = (ϕ?β ϕ?αβ ∇e )X Y = ϕ?β ∇e ,
where in the last step we used the fact that ϕ?αβ ∇e = ∇e , that is, affine
transformations in Euclidean space preserve parallelism.
It follows from the definition of ∇M that for every local chart (Uα , ϕα ),


α
−1
∗ ∂
∂i = dϕα ϕα i
∂x
is a parallel vector field. To transport a vector in parallel within a given
chart (Uα , ϕα ) we write v ∈ Tp Uα as
v = v i ∂iα |p .
Denoting by Πqp : Tp Uα → Tq Uα the parallel transport operator, we have
Πqp (v) = v i ∂iα |q .
It is easy to see that the induced connection ∇M inherits the properties
of the Euclidean connection:
Proposition 2.1 ∇M is flat and torsion-free.

which proves that the torsion is zero. A similar argument shows that the
curvature is zero as well.
n
To summarize, every affine manifold is equipped with a natural flat and
torsion-free connection. For a locally Euclidean manifold, this connection is
the Riemannian Levi-Civita connection.

Monodromy

The flatness of the connection on M implies that parallel transport in T M
is path-independent within every homotopy class. If the defective body is
simply-connected (as is the case, for example, for point defects in three dimensions), then parallel transport is totally path-independent. Otherwise,
parallel transport depends on the homotopy class of the curve. In this case
it is useful to analyze the affine manifold through its universal cover.

3.1

The universal cover

Let p ∈ M; we denote as usual by π1 (M, p) the fundamental group of M at p.
Every g ∈ π1 (M, p) is a homotopy class of curves γ : I → M, satisfying γ(0) =
γ(1) = p. π1 (M, p) is a group with respect to curve concatenation (gh is the
homotopy class [η ∗ γ], where γ ∈ g and η ∈ h). Although the fundamental
group depends on the reference point, π1 (M, p) and π1 (M, q) are isomorphic.
However, there is no canonical isomorphism unless the fundamental group is
abelian (see below).
We next introduce the notion of a universal cover; see e.g., Hatcher [13]
for a thorough presentation of the algebraic-topological constructs used in
this section.
Definition 3.1 A manifold M̃ along with a map π : M̃ → M is a covering
space for M, if for every p ∈ M there exists an open neighborhood Up ⊂ M,
such that π −1 (Up ) is a union of disjoint sets, each homeomorphic to Up . The
map π is called a projection, and the set π −1 (p) is called the fiber of M̃ over
p. A universal cover of M is a simply-connected covering space.
It is a known fact that a universal cover exists if M is connected, pathconnected, and semi-locally simply-connected, all of which we will assume.
Moreover, the universal cover is unique up to isomorphism. The universal
cover can be constructed explicitly from the fundamental groupoid of all
homotopy classes of curves in M.
The universal cover M̃ inherits the flat torsion-free connection of M,
M̃
∇ = π ? ∇M , namely,

−1
∇M̃
(π ∗ ∇M )X dπ(Y )
X, Y ∈ Γ(T M̃).
(1)
X Y = dπ
Since M̃ is simply-connected and ∇M̃ is flat and torsion-free, it follows that
parallel transport in T M̃ is path-independent. For p, q ∈ M̃, we denote by
10

Π̃qp : Tp M̃ → Tq M̃ the parallel transport operator from p to q. For γ : I → M,
let Πγ : Tγ(0) M → Tγ(1) M denote parallel transport along γ. Note that
Π̃qp = dπq−1 ◦ Πγ ◦ dπp ,

(2)

where γ is the projection of a curve that connects p to q An important
property of covering spaces is the existence of a unique lift of curves (see
Proposition 1.34 in [13]): Let γ : I → M with γ(0) = p. For every p̃ ∈ π −1 (p)
there exists a unique curve γ̃ : I → M̃ satisfying π ◦ γ̃ = γ (i.e., γ̃ is a lift of
γ) and γ̃(0) = p̃.

3.2

Deck transformations

Covering spaces come with automorphisms called deck transformations, which
are homeomorphisms f : M̃ → M̃ satisfying
π ◦ f = π.

(3)

That is, a deck transformation maps continuously every point in the covering space to a point that lies on the same fiber. It is easy to see that
deck transformations form a group under composition, which we denote by
deck(M̃).
There exists a close connection between deck(M̃) and π1 (M), which we
present in the following propositions. The proofs, which are all classical, are
given in order to demonstrate how the structure of a manifold is revealed
through its universal cover.
Proposition 3.1 A deck transformation of a path connected covering space
is uniquely determined by its value at a single point.
Proof : Let ϕ1 , ϕ2 ∈ deck(M̃) satisfy
ϕ1 (p) = ϕ2 (p) = p̃.
Suppose that there exists a point q ∈ M̃ for which
q1 = ϕ1 (q) 6= ϕ2 (q) = q2 .
Let α : I → M̃ be a curve that connects q with p and let β : I → M̃ be a
curve that connects p with p̃. The curves
γ1 = (ϕ1 ◦ α−1 ) ∗ β ∗ α
γ2 = (ϕ2 ◦ α−1 ) ∗ β ∗ α,
11

Figure 1: Construction of a deck transformation given that p is mapped into
p̃.
connect q to q1 and q2 respectively. However,
π ◦ γ1 = (π ◦ α−1 ) ∗ (π ◦ β) ∗ (π ◦ α) = π ◦ γ2 ,
and γ1 (0) = γ2 (0) = q, thus violating the unique lift property. This uniqueness proof shows in fact how to construct the deck transformation given its
value at a single point (Figure 1).
n
Proposition 3.2 Let M̃ be the universal cover of M. Given a reference
point p ∈ M̃, there exists a canonical isomorphism between deck(M̃) and
π1 (M, π(p)). If the fundamental group is abelian, then this isomorphism is
independent of the reference point.
Proof : Given a reference point p, to every ϕ ∈ deck(M̃) corresponds an
element g ∈ π1 (M, π(p)) by taking a loop in M that is the projection of a
curve in M̃ that connects p to ϕ(p). It is easy to see that this mapping is
well defined and does not depend on the chosen curve. Conversely, to every
g ∈ π1 (M, π(p)) corresponds a deck transformation, by mapping p to the end
point of the unique lift of a curve γ : I → M that represents g (see Figure 2).
It is easy to see that this mapping between deck transformations and the
fundamental group is both bijective and preserves the group structure, i.e.,
it is an isomorphism, which we denote by Φ(·, p) : deck(M̃) → π1 (M, p).
12

Figure 2: The relation between π1 (M) and deck(M̃). Fix a point p ∈ M̃.
Given a loop γ in M based at π(p), the corresponding deck transformation
ϕ is the unique one such that ϕ(p) is the endpoint of the lift of γ starting at
p. By Proposition 3.1, deck transformations are fully specified by their value
at a single point.
Let p0 be another point on the same fiber as p. Let γ be a curve that
connects p to p0 and let β be a curve that connects p to ϕ(p). Then,


Φ(ϕ, p0 ) = π ◦ (ϕ ◦ γ) ∗ β ∗ γ −1 = [π ◦ ϕ ◦ γ] · [π ◦ β] · [π ◦ γ −1 ].
Note that
[π ◦ β] = Φ(ϕ, p),

[π ◦ ϕ ◦ γ] = [π ◦ γ]

and

[π ◦ γ −1 ] = [π ◦ γ]−1 .

Hence
Φ(ϕ, p0 ) = [π ◦ γ] · Φ(ϕ, p) · [π ◦ γ]−1 ,
and the mapping Φ(ϕ, p) is independent of p if and only if the fundamental
group is abelian.
n
Deck transformations leave the connection invariant:
Proposition 3.3 Let ϕ ∈ deck(M̃). Then,
ϕ? ∇M̃ = ∇M̃ .

13

Proof : Note that both ∇M̃ and ϕ? ∇M̃ are connections on T M̃. Now,
ϕ? ∇M̃ = ϕ? π ? ∇M = π ? ∇M = ∇M̃ ,
where the identity ϕ? π ? = π ? follows from the identity π ◦ ϕ = π.
n
A consequence of this invariance is that the differential of any deck transformation is a parallel section.
Proposition 3.4 Let ϕ ∈ deck(M̃). Then,
dϕ ∈ Γ(M̃; T ∗ M̃ ⊗ ϕ∗ T M̃)
is a parallel section.
Proof : Let f : M̃ → N, let Φ ∈ Γ(M̃; T ∗ M̃ ⊗ f ∗ T N), and let X, v ∈
ˆ the connection on T ∗ M̃ ⊗ f ∗ T N induced by the
Γ(M̃; T M̃). Denote by ∇
connections ∇M̃ and f ∗ ∇N . By definition,
ˆ X Φ)(v) + Φ(∇M̃
(f ∗ ∇N )X Φ(v) = (∇
X v).
In the present case we take N = M̃, f = ϕ, and Φ = dϕ. Hence,

The monodromy of an affine manifold

The usefulness of the universal cover M̃ with its geometric properties pulled
back from M stems from the fact that on the one hand it has patches that
are “genuine replica” of M, and on other hand, parallel transport on its
tangent space is path-independent. The ability to transport vectors allows an
unambiguous definition of a “displacement vector” with respect to a reference
point, which is known as a developing map:
Definition 3.2 Fix p ∈ M̃. The developing map,
dev : M̃ → Tp M̃
is defined as follows: for every q ∈ M̃ choose a curve γ : I → M̃ that connects
p with q. Then,
Z 1
dev(q) =
Π̃pγ(t) (γ̇(t)) dt.
0

14

Since ∇M̃ is torsion free, this definition is independent of the chosen
curve. This can be shown as follows: Define a differential 1-form ω on M̃
with coefficients in Tp M̃ by parallel transport, namely,
ωq = Π̃pq .
The developing map is then given by
Z
ω,

dev(q) =

(4)

γ

where γ : I → M̃ connects p with q. Cartan’s first structural equation implies
that dω = 0. Since M̃ is simply-connected, the integral is path independent
by Stokes’ theorem.
The developing map is the geometric equivalent of the crystallographic
practice of counting discrete steps. Note that the common practice is to define
the developing map into Rn using a trivialization of the tangent bundle; we
have reasons that will become apparent below to associated the developing
map with a particular tangent space.
Note that both M̃ and Tp M̃ are affine manifolds. It follows from (4) that
the developing map preserves the affine structure in the following sense:
Proposition 3.5
d devq (v) = Π̃pq (v),
where on the right hand side we use the canonical identification of Tdev(q) Tp M̃
with Tp M̃.
The developing map is a useful tool for studying curves in M that surround defects, by studying how the developing map changes along their lift
in M̃. Fix a deck transformation ϕ. Given q ∈ M̃, we express dev(ϕ(q)) by
integrating along a curve that connects p and ϕ(q) that is a concatenation
of the form
α = (ϕ ◦ γ) ∗ β,
where γ is a curve the connects p and q, and β connects p with ϕ(p) (see
Figure 3).

the reference point p.
To further simplify the second term on the right hand side we need the
following lemma:
Lemma 3.1 For every q ∈ M̃,
ϕ(p)

Π̃ϕ(q) ◦ dϕq = dϕp ◦ Π̃pq .

(6)

Proof : Let γ : I → M̃ be a curve that connects q with p. Then, the curve
ϕ ◦ γ : I → M̃ connects ϕ(q) with ϕ(p). Let ξ(t) be a parallel vector field
along γ(t) and let η(t) be a parallel vector field along ϕ ◦ γ, satisfying
η(0) = dϕq (ξ(0))

(7)

(see Figure 4). We show below that
η(t) = dϕγ(t) (ξ(t)).
16

(8)

Figure 4: Construction for the proof of Lemma 3.1.
Since η(t) is a parallel vector field
ϕ(p)

ϕ(p)

η(1) = Π̃ϕ(q) η(0) = Π̃ϕ(q) ◦ dϕq (ξ(0)).
On the other hand, by (8) and since ξ(t) is a parallel vector field,
η(1) = dϕγ(1) (ξ(1)) = dϕp ◦ Π̃pq (ξ(0)).
Since this holds for arbitrary ξ(0) we obtain the desired result.
It remains to prove (8). dϕγ(t) (ξ(t)) is a vector field along ϕ ◦ γ that
satisfies the initial conditions (7). To show that it is equal to η(t) it only
remains to show that it is parallel, which follows from the fact that both dϕ
(by Proposition 3.4) and ξ(t) are parallel sections.

For a vector space V , let Aff(V ) denotes the space of affine transformations of V .
Theorem 3.1 There exists mϕ ∈ Aff(Tp M̃) such that
dev(ϕ(q)) = mϕ (dev(q))
for all q ∈ M̃. Explicitly, mϕ is given by
mϕ (v) = Aϕ v + bϕ ,
with Aϕ ∈ End(Tp M̃) given by
Aϕ = Π̃pϕ(p) ◦ dϕp ,

(9)

bϕ = dev(ϕ(p)).

hence
dev(ϕ(q)) = dev(ϕ(p)) +

Let
m : deck(M̃) −→ Aff(Tp M̃)
be given by ϕ 7→ mϕ . As shown next, this mapping is a group homomorphism,
and it is called the monodromy of the affine manifold M.
Proposition 3.6 m is a group homomorphism, namely,
mϕ◦ψ = mϕ ◦ mψ .
Proof : By definition,
ϕ(p)

Aϕ◦ψ = Π̃pϕ◦ψ(p) ◦ dϕψ(p) ◦ dψp = Π̃pϕ(p) ◦ Π̃ϕ◦ψ(p) ◦ dϕψ(p) ◦ dψp .
We use once again (6) to obtain
ϕ(p)

Π̃ϕ◦ψ(p) ◦ dϕψ(p) = dϕp ◦ Π̃pψ(p) .
Hence,
Aϕ◦ψ = Π̃pϕ(p) ◦ dϕp ◦ Π̃pψ(p) ◦ dψp = Aϕ ◦ Aψ .
Finally, using the fact that dev ◦ϕ = Aϕ ◦ dev +bϕ and dev(ψ(p)) = bψ ,
bϕ◦ψ = dev(ϕ ◦ ψ(p))
= Aϕ dev(ψ(p)) + dev(ϕ(p))
= Aϕ bψ + bϕ .
18

Thus,
mϕ◦ψ (v) = Aϕ◦ψ v + bϕ◦ψ = Aϕ Aψ v + Aϕ bψ + bϕ = mϕ ◦ mψ (v).
n
Having explicit expressions for the affine transformations mϕ , we turn to
study their properties. In particular, we allow the reference point to vary
and view the developing map as a function
dev : M̃ × M̃ → T M̃,
such that $(dev(p, q)) = p, where $ : T M̃ → M̃ is the canonical projection.
From this angle, we may view m as a homomorphism from the group of deck
transformations to the group of sections of the principal bundle Aff(T M̃).
The next proposition states that Aϕ is determined by its value at a single
point:
Proposition 3.7 Aϕ is a parallel section of End(T M̃).
Proof : Define Π̃ϕ ∈ Γ(M̃; ϕ∗ T M̃ ⊗ T M̃) by
(Π̃ϕ )p = Π̃pϕ(p) .
Then
Aϕ = Π̃ϕ ◦ dϕ,
which is a parallel section of End(T M̃). Indeed, both dϕ and Π̃ϕ are parallel sections, the first by Proposition 3.4 and the second because parallel
transport is path independent.
n
The analogous statement for bϕ is more subtle.
Proposition 3.8 bϕ is a parallel vector field if and only if Aϕ is the identity
section of End(T M̃).
Proof : By definition,
Z
(bϕ )p =

Π̃pβϕ,p (t) (β̇ϕ,p (t)) dt.

where βϕ,p is a curve that connects p to ϕ(p). For q ∈ M̃ set
βϕ,q = (ϕ ◦ γ −1 ) ∗ βϕ,p ∗ γ,
19

where γ is a curve from


Π̃qγ(t) Id − (Aϕ )γ(t) (γ̇(t)) dt.

If Aϕ = Id, then
(bϕ )q = Π̃qp (bϕ )p .
To show that this condition is also necessary, consider the vector field (bϕ )α(t)
along a curve α. Then
D
(bϕ )α(t) = (Id − (Aϕ )α(t) )(α̇(t)).
dt
If at some point along the curve (Aϕ )α(t) 6= Id, then the vector field is not
parallel.
n
The existence of the monodromy and its properties considered so far only
depend on the affine structure of M, and not on its metric properties. The
last two properties are of metric nature:
Proposition 3.9 Aϕ ∈ O(T M̃).
Proof : Since Aϕ = Π̃ϕ ◦ dϕ, and both sections are norm preserving, their
composition is a norm preserving endomorphism.
n
Proposition 3.10 For a fixed reference point, the developing map dev :
M̃ → Tp M̃ is a local isometry.
Proof : This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.5 and the fact
that parallel transport is compatible with the metric.

3.4

The abelian case: monodromy as sections over M

The universal cover M̃ is a useful mathematical construct to study the geometry of the locally-Euclidean manifold M. But from the point of view of
material science, one would like to study defects with geometric constructs
20

that are defined on M rather than M̃. In particular, one would like to make
geometric measurements along curves in M rather than along curves in M̃.
The monodromy is a homomorphism m : deck(M̃) → Γ(M̃, Aff(T M̃)).
Although deck transformations can be related to π1 (M), this relation depends
on the choice of a reference point in M̃. Hence, in the general case, monodromy cannot be associated with loops in M. The exception is when π1 (M)
is abelian, in which case to every element g ∈ π1 (M) corresponds a deck
transformation, which we denote by ϕg . Hence, we consider the monodromy
as a homomorphism m : π1 (M) → Γ(M̃, Aff(T M̃)), and for g ∈ π1 (M) we
write mg (v) = Ag v+bg . Note that we haven’t yet got rid of the covering space
as the range of m is sections of the principal bundle Aff(T M̃). However, as
will be shown below, Ag can always be identified with a section of End(T M),
whereas bg can under specific conditions be identified with a vector field in
M.
Before we proceed, we note that the abelian case is quite generic in the
following sense: in addition to being directly applicable to both disclinations
and screw dislocations, it is also applicable to more complicated defects if
one restricts oneself to loops that surround all the defect loci.
Theorem 3.2 Suppose that π1 (M) is abelian. To every g ∈ π1 (M) corre? M
sponds a section AM
g ∈ Γ(M; End(T M)) such that Ag = π Ag , namely,
Ag = dπ −1 ◦ (π ∗ AM
g ) ◦ dπ.
Moreover, (AM
g )p is the parallel transport operator along any loop γ representing g based at p.
Proof : This is an immediate consequence of parallel transport in T M̃ being
the pullback under π of parallel transport in T M. Denote by ϕg the deck
transformation that corresponds to g. Such a deck transformation is uniquely
determined without reference to basepoint because of the hypothesis that
π1 (M ) is abelian. Let
Π̃g : ϕ∗g T M̃ → T M̃
be given by parallel transport. Then,
Ag = Π̃g ◦ dϕg .

21

Since π is a local diffeomorphism, we may write


Ag = dπ −1 ◦ dπ ◦ Π̃g ◦ dϕg ◦ dπ −1 ◦ dπ


= dπ −1 ◦ dπ ◦ Π̃g ◦ ϕ∗g (dπ −1 ) ◦ dπ,
where the last transition follows from equation (3). It follows from equation (2) that the expression in parentheses is a section of End(π ∗ T M) pulled
back from a section of End(T M). Namely, evaluated at the point p ∈ M, it
is the pull-back of the parallel transport operator along the loop γ = π ◦ β,
where β is a curve that connects ϕ(q) to q with q ∈ π −1 (p). The choice of q
is irrelevant because of the abelian hypothesis.

Examples

In this section we examine a number of classical defects using the formalism
developed in the previous section.

has 5 neighbors and its center is a source of positive Gaussian curvature. (c)

4.1

Disclinations

Disclinations are two-dimensional line defects, i.e., the locus of the defect is
a straight line, and the intrinsic geometry of the body is axially symmetric.
Isolated disclinations are not common in crystals due to their high energetic cost, but are more common in quasi-two-dimensional systems, such as
monolayers of liquid crystals.
Disclinations as topological defects were first introduced by Volterra [24]
using the cut-and-weld procedure; see Figure 5a. There are two types of
disclinations: positive disclinations, in which a cylindrical wedge is removed
and the faces of the cut are welded, and negative disclinations, in which a
cylindrical wedge is inserted after a half-plane has been cut (disclinations are
often called wedge defects). The sign of the disclination is dictated by the
sign of the Gaussian curvature at its locus. In crystals, disclinations are also
characterized by either a missing wedge or an extra wedge, in which case the
disclination angle is determined by the structure of the unperturbed lattice;
see Figure 5b,c.
Adopting the terminology of the present paper, disclinations are singular
defects, in which the body M is hemeomorphic to the three-dimensional
Euclidean space with a line removed. The fundamental group is isomorphic
23

to the additive group π1 (M) ∼
= Z, where an integer k ∈ Z corresponds to a
loop that surrounds the disclination line k times; the sign of k determines
the handedness of the loops. In particular, the fundamental group is abelian
so that the results of Section 3.4 apply.
We parametrize M using cylindrical coordinates (R, Φ, Z), with R > 0,
and identifying Φ = 0 and Φ = 2π. The metric on M can be defined in
several equivalent ways:
1. Local charts The first way is to construct local charts {(Uβ , ϕβ )} and
define the metric on M as the pullback metric, g = ϕ?β e. Let {Φβ } be
a collection of angles. We define local charts
(xβ , yβ , zβ ) = ϕβ (R, Φ, Z),
where
xβ = R cos α(Φ − Φβ )

yβ = R sin α(Φ − Φβ )

and

zβ = Z,
(11)
where α > 0 (α > 1 for negative disclinations and 0 < α < 1 for
positive disclinations). The range of Φ has to be smaller than both
2π and 2π/α. It can be checked explicitly that all the transition maps
ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
γ are rigid rotations.
2. Orthonormal frame field A second way to define a metric on M is,
following [27], to introduce a frame field,
e1 = ∂R

e2 =

1
∂Φ
αR

e3 = ∂Z ,

with dual co-frame,
ϑ1 = dR

ϑ2 = αR dΦ

ϑ3 = dZ,

and set the metric to be that with respect to which this frame field is
orthonormal, namely,
g = dR ⊗ dR + α2 R2 dΦ ⊗ dΦ + dZ ⊗ dZ.
To show that (M, g) is indeed locally Euclidean we calculate the Riemann curvature tensor using Cartan’s formalism. We first calculate the
24

Levi-Civita connection using Cartan’s first structural equations. Introducing an anti-symmetric matrix of connection 2-forms ω α β satisfying
∇X eα = ω β α (X) eβ ,
Cartan’s first structural equations are
dϑα + ω α β ∧ ϑβ = 0.
It is easy to check that the only non-zero connection form is
1
ω 1 2 = − ϑ2 = −α dΦ.
R
Note that the fact that the connection form does not vanish implies
that the chosen frame field is not parallel with respect to the Riemannian connection. The curvature form is obtained from Cartan’s second
structural equations,
Ωα β = −dω α β − ω α γ ∧ ω γ β .
An explicit substitution shows that the right hand side vanishes, i.e.,
this Riemannian manifold is locally flat.
3. Conformal representation A third way of defining a metric on M
uses the two-dimensional character of disclinations, and the fact that
every two-dimensional metric is locally conformal to the Euclidean metric. We adopt a parametrization
M = {(X, Y, Z) ∈ R3 : X 2 + Y 2 6= 0},
i.e., the Z-axis is locus of the disclination. The metric is assumed to
be of the following form
g = e2%(X,Y ) (dX ⊗ dX + dY ⊗ dY ) + dZ ⊗ dZ,
where %(X, Y ) is the conformal factor. Liouville’s equation states that
this metric is locally flat if and only if the Laplacian of % vanishes, which
implies that flat metrics of this form can be generated by taking % to be
any harmonic function. A disclination has cylindrical symmetry, and
corresponds to
% = β log(X 2 + Y 2 ),
(12)
where β is the magnitude of the disclination; β > 0 corresponds to the
insertion of a wedge, whereas β < 0 corresponds to the removal of a
wedge.
25

We proceed to obtain an explicit expression for parallel transport in T M.
We may use any of the parametrizations introduced above.

2. Conformal representation Since parallel transport along the Z axis
is trivial, we focus on the parallel transport of vectors within the XY plane. For that we construct a (local) parallel orthonormal frame. Let
θ(X, Y ) be a function to be determined. Any frame field of the form
e1 = e−% (cos θ ∂X − sin θ ∂Y ) ,
e2 = e−% (sin θ ∂X + cos θ ∂Y ) .
26

(13)

is orthonormal. The dual co-frame field is
ϑ1 = e% (cos θ dX − sin θ dY ) ,
ϑ2 = e% (sin θ dX + cos θ dY ) .
The condition for the frame field (e1 , e2 ) to be parallel is that dϑ1 =
dϑ2 = 0. It is easy to check that this is satisfied if %(X, Y ) and θ(X, Y )
satisfiy the Cauchy-Riemann equations,

which has a branch cut that can be chosen to be along the negative Xaxis. Thus, to parallel transport a vector v ∈ Tp M to another point on
the same plane, we first represent it with respect to the basis {e1 , e2 }.
Since this is a parallel frame, the components of the transported vector
remain invariant. We will use this approach when we consider edge
dislocations.
We proceed to construct the universal cover M̃ of M in order to put into
action the formalism derived in the previous section. Since M is homotopy
equivalent to a circle, whose universal cover is a line, the universal cover of
M is homotopy equivalent to the line. A natural parametrization for M̃ is
(R, Θ, Z) ∈ (0, ∞) × R × R,
where the projection map π : M̃ → M is
π(R, Θ, Z) = (R, Θ

mod 2π, Z).

The lift of a loop γk ∈ π1 (M, p), p = (R, Φ, Z), that surrounds the disclination line k times and starts at (R, Φ+2π`, Z), ends at (R, Φ+2π(`+k), Z).
Thus, for k ∈ Z, the corresponding deck transformation is
ϕk (R, Θ, Z) = (R, Θ + 2πk, Z)
27

Figure 6: The universal cover of the manifold that models a disclination.
(the existence of a natural isomorphism from π1 (M) to deck(M̃) is due to
the former being abelian).
Parallel transport in T M̃ is induced by parallel transport in T M. Let
p = (R, Θ, Z) and p0 = (R0 , Θ0 , Z0 ). For a tangent vector v ∈ Tp M̃ of the
form
v = v R ∂R |p + v Θ ∂Θ |p + v Z ∂Z |p .

With this we proceed to calculate the developing map, dev : M̃ → Tp M̃,
for p = (R0 , Θ0 , Z0 ). Let γ(t) = (R(t), Θ(t), Z(t)) be a curve based at p.

This is easily integrated, yielding

+ [R sin(αΘ) − R0 sin(αΘ0 )] ∂y |p
+ (Z − Z0 ) ∂z |p .
We henceforth represent the developing map as a column vector whose entries
are the components of the parallel frame (∂x , ∂y , ∂z ),


R cos(αΘ) − R0 cos(αΘ0 )
dev(R, Θ, Z) =  R sin(αΘ) − R0 sin(αΘ0 )  .
Z − Z0
From this we easily calculate the monodromy. Let k ∈ Z. Then for
q = (R, Θ, Z),
dev(ϕk (q)) = dev(R, Θ + 2πk, Z) = Ak dev(q) + bk ,
where

As expected, the linear part Ak of the monodromy is a parallel section of
End(T M̃) (its representation in a parallel frame does not depend on the
coordinates). It is a rotation by an angle 2παk about the Z-axis. Unless
Ak − I = 0 the translation part bk is not a parallel vector field.

procedure. (b) Screw disclocation in a lattice structure.

4.2

Screw dislocations

Screw dislocations are also line defects, and like disclinations, their intrinsic
geometry is axially symmetric. Like disclinations, screw dislocations were
first introduced by Volterra (albeit the term was only coined later). The
Volterra procedure for creating a screw dislocation is to cut a half-plane in
the body and weld it with a fixed offset parallel to the half-plane’s boundary;
see Figure 7a. A visualization of a screw dislocation in a lattice is shown in
Figure 7b.
The topology of a body with a screw dislocation is identical to that of a
body with a disclination; it is only the metric that differs. We parametrize
M using the same cylindrical coordinates (R, Φ, Z) as for disclinations.
Once again, there are several alternatives for prescribing the metric on
M:
1. Local charts Let
x = R cos(Φ−Φβ )

y = R sin(Φ−Φβ )

and

z = Z−h(Φ−Φβ ),

where h is a fixed offset and Φ ∈ (0, 2π). The metric on M is then the
pullback metric.

30

2. Orthonormal frame field Following [28], we define an orthonormal
frame field,
e 1 = ∂R

e2 =

h
1
∂Φ + ∂Z
R
R

e 3 = ∂Z .

The dual co-frame is
ϑ1 = dR

ϑ2 = R dΦ

ϑ3 = dZ − h dΦ.

The metric with respect to which this frame field is orthonormal is:
g = dR ⊗ dR + (R2 + h2 ) dΦ ⊗ dΦ + dZ ⊗ dZ − h (dΦ ⊗ dZ + dZ ⊗ dΦ).
To show that (M, g) is locally Euclidean we use again Cartan’s formalism. The only non-zero connection form is
ω 1 2 = −dΦ,
so Ωα β = 0.
To obtain an explicit formula for the parallel transport of vectors, we
follow a procedure similar to that for disclinations. For p = (R, Φ, Z),
 

Thus, for a screw dislocation the linear part of the monodromy is the identity section of End(T M̃), and therefore, as expected, the components of the
translational part are independent of q, namely, the translational part is a
parallel vector field. Moreover, it is a vector field parallel to the z-axis, i.e.,
parallel to the locus of the dislocation, as is expected for the Burgers vector
of a screw dislocation.

Edge dislocations

Edge dislocations, like disclinations, are planar defects, that is the geometry
of the body is axially symmetric. The Volterra cut-and-weld procedure that
generates an edge dislocation is depicted in Figure 8a. Like in a screw dislocation, the body is cut by a half-plane, however it is welded with a fixed offset
perpendicular to the half-plane’s boundary. If b denotes the fixed offset, then
the locus of the dislocation has to be a slit whose length is b. A visualization
of an edge dislocation in a lattice is shown in Figure 8b. It is created by
an extra half-plane of atoms inserted through the lattice, distorting nearby
planes of atoms. Note that it is not a priori clear why both visualizations
correspond to the same type of defect.
Another description of an edge dislocation is as a pair of wedge disclinations of opposite magnitudes. Thus, if a disclination is viewed as a two33

dimensional point charge of Gaussian curvature, an edge dislocation should
be viewed as a dipole of Gaussian curvature. In an hexagonal lattice, the
common occurrence of a wedge-anti-wedge pair is in the form of a pentagonheptagon pair [23]; see Figure 9.
Since the geometry of this defect is two-dimensional we will limit our
analysis to a plane, which we parametrize using the coordinates (X, Y ). We
define the metric of an edge dislocation using a two-dimensional conformal
representation,
g = e2%(X,Y ) (dX ⊗ dX + dY ⊗ dY ) .
Recall that such a metric is locally-Euclidean if and only if % is harmonic.
Since we model an edge dislocation as a wedge anti-wedge pair, the locus of
the defect is a pair of parallel lines (points in two dimensions), which we take
to be
{p1 = (−a, 0), p2 = (a, 0)}.
A conformal factor that corresponds to two disclinations of opposite signs is,

%(X, Y ) = β log[(X − a)2 + Y 2 ] − log[(X + a)2 + Y 2 ] .

which can be defined as a smooth function with a branch cut on the segment
along the X axis that connects the two loci of the defect. θ has a jump
discontinuity of magnitude 4πβ across the branch cut (See Figure 10).
With the aid of θ(X, Y ), we can prescribe how to parallel transport vectors as long as they do not cross the branch cut. The frame field {e1 , e2 }
given by (13) is parallel. Note that the fact that there exists a global parallel
frame field at the exterior of a bounded domain indicates the existence of
distant parallelism, which is a characteristic of edge dislocations.
Inverting (13) we get
∂X = e% (cos θ e1 + sin θ e2 )
∂Y = e% (− sin θ e1 + cos θ e2 ).

between the two loci of the defect yields,

+ e%(p)−%(p0 ) v X sin θ(p) + v Y cos θ(p) (sin θ(p0 )∂X |p0 + cos θ(p0 )∂Y |p0 ) .
In particular, for later use
Πpp0 (∂X |p ) = e%(p)−%(p0 ) (cos(θ(p) − θ(p0 ))∂X |p0 + sin(θ(p) − θ(p0 ))∂Y |p0 ) .
(16)
We now turn to calculate the monodromy of an edge dislocation. The
fundamental group of a plane with two punctures is the free group on two
generators. Namely, the first generator is the homotopy class of loops that
circle once around the point (−a, 0) but do not encircle the other point. The
other generator is the homotopy class of loops that circle once around the
point (a, 0). Indeed, the doubly punctured plane is homotopic to a figure-ofeight. Since we are interested in the structure induced by both defect lines
together rather than each separately, we redefine the defect locus D to be
the closed segment [−a, a] × {0}. In particular, since the fundamental group
is abelian, we can associate the monodromy with sections over M.
The existence of a “distant” parallel frame field implies that the linear
part of the monodromy is trivial, namely
Ag = Id.
To calculate the translational part of the monodromy, we take an arbitrary
reference point p0 , denote %0 = %(p0 ), θ0 = θ(p0 ), and take the contour shown
in Figure 11. This contour represents the generator g of the fundamental
group. Then, using equation (16), we obtain
bg |p0 = e−%0 dist(p1 , p2 ) [cos(2πβ − θ0 ) − cos(2πβ + θ0 )] ∂X |p0
+ e−%0 dist(p1 , p2 ) [sin(2πβ − θ0 ) + sin(2πβ + θ0 )] ∂Y |p0
= 2e−%0 dist(p1 , p2 ) sin(2πβ) (sin θ0 ∂X |p0 + cos θ0 ∂Y |p0 ) .
36

Figure 11: The contour used in the calculation of the translational part of
the monodromy of an edge dislocation.
For |p0 |  1 we get,
bg |p0 ≈ 2 dist(p1 , p2 ) sin(2πβ) ∂Y |p0 .
As expected, bg is a parallel vector field, whose magnitude depends on the
distance between the two disclinations and on the magnitude of the disclinations.

4.4

Higher multipoles: the Stone-Wales defect

Disclinations and edge dislocations are two-dimensional defects; disclinations
are generated by point sources (monopoles) of Gaussian curvature, whereas
edge dislocations are generated by dipoles of Gaussian curvatures. Like in
the electrostatic analog, the dipole moment is independent of the reference
point if and only if the monopole vanishes. Unlike in the electrostatic analog,
the dipole moment can be calculated exactly and not just asymptotically at
infinity. This is quite interesting as the Liouville equation that relates the
Gaussian curvature to the Laplacian of the conformal factor can be viewed as
a nonlinear analog of the linear Gauss equation in electrostatics. Therefore,
its solutions are expected to be less amenable to explicit computations.
In analogy to electrostatics, one is also interested in defects that are higher
order multipoles of Gaussian curvature. An example of such a defect is the
Stone-Wales defect found in graphene, where four hexagonal cells transform
37

Figure 12: The Stone-Wales defect: four hexagons are converted into two
pentagon-heptagon pairs.
into two pentagon-heptagon pairs [23] (Figure 12). Since pentagons and heptagons constitute disclinations of opposite signs, and since the configuration
of the two pentagon-heptagon pairs is anti-linear, the Stone-Wales defect
constitutes a metric quadrupole.
Suppose we removed a part of the lattice that contains the two pentagonheptagon pairs. The remaining lattice would be perfect, i.e., isometrically
embeddable in the plane. This is obvious as the Stone-Wales defect can be
eliminated by a purely local change of lattice connectivities. This is not the
case for a single pentagon-heptagon pair, where the defect can be detected
at any distance from its locus. Thus, we expect a fundamental difference
between metric monopoles and dipoles on the one hand, and higher metric
multipoles on the other hand.
Motivated by the Stone-Wales defect, we consider a metric quadrupole,
which can be realized using a two-dimensional conformal representation with
four disclinations,

The branch cuts of the four addends can be chosen such that θ is smooth
outside the rectangle whose vertices are the singular points, see Figure 13.
Like for a doubly-punctured plane, we will restrict our attention to loops
that encircle all four singular points. Namely, we redefine the defect locus
D to be the rectangle [−a, a] × [−a, a]. Then symmetry considerations show
that the monodromy is trivial. This implies, as we show, that the defect
is local in the following sense: there exists compact subset K ⊂ M such
that M \ K embeds isometrically in the plane. In other words, except for
a bounded region around the loci of the defect, the entire surface can be
embedded isometrically (not only locally) in the Euclidean plane.
Theorem 4.1 Let M be R2 \ [−a, a]2 equipped with the Riemannian metric
determined by the conformal factor (17). Then there exists a compact set
K ⊂ M such that M \ K embeds in the plane.
Proof : We will exploit the relation between conformal coordinates and complex manifolds. Denote Z = X + i Y . Since the monodromy is trivial, the
developing map descends to a map
dev : M → Tp0 M,
for any p0 ∈ M. If
dev(X, Y ) = x(X, Y ) ∂X |p0 + y(X, Y ) ∂Y |p0 ,
39

then set devC : C → C to be
devC (Z) = x(X, Y ) + i y(X, Y ).

The trivial monodromy implies that (18) is path-independent.
The developing map is a local isometry. It remains to show that up to
the possible exclusion of a compact set it is one-to-one, i.e., that devC is
one-to-one in a neighborhood of infinity. Note that
dev0C (Z) = e%C (Z)−%C (Z0 ) ,
which has a non-zero limit e−%C (Z0 ) at infinity. Hence, devC (Z) has an expansion

It follows that g 0 has a removable singularity at zero and a non-zero limit.
By the inverse function theorem, g is one-to-one in a neighborhood of zero,
and therefore devC is one-to-one in a neighborhood of infinity. Note that this
analysis is applicable for every conformally represented metric with trivial
monodromy and a conformal factor that vanishes at infinity.

Two-dimensional defects with trivial monodromy:
the general case

The result of the previous subsection whereby a locally Euclidean surface
with trivial monodromy embeds (excluding a compact set) in the Euclidean
plane can be generalized without requiring the existence of a global system of
isothermal coordinates. In fact, it can be formulated as a theorem for affine
embeddings.
Theorem 4.2 Let M be a connected affine manifold with boundary. Suppose
that
1. M is geodesically complete, i.e., geodesics extend indefinitely unless they
hit the boundary.
2. π1 (M) = Z.
3. ∂M is homeomorphic to a circle.
4. M has trivial monodromy.
5. There exists a simple closed curve in M that is not null homotopic (i.e.,
not contractible) and has winding number one.
Then, there exists a compact subset K ⊂ M, such that M \ K embeds affinely
in the Euclidean plane.
Recall that the winding number of a closed curve in the plane is the total
number of times that its tangent rotates. The winding number of a curve in
M is well-defined because tangent vectors can be translated unambiguously
to a joint reference point. In fact, the winding number of a closed curve is
given by the winding number of its image under the developing map.
Proof : Since the proof is somewhat long and technical, we will break it into
short steps:
(i) M is an affine manifold. A locally Euclidean metric can be defined on
M by prescribing an inner-product on Tp M for some arbitrary point p,
and parallel transporting tangent vectors to p; Assumption 4 guarantees
that parallel transport is path-independent.

41

(ii) Geodesic completeness implies metric completeness. This is the wellknown Hopf-Rinow theorem ([9], pp. 146–149). Note that the classical
theorem is for a geodesically complete manifold without boundary. It
is not hard to generalize the Hopf-Rinow theorem to manifolds with
boundary: A manifold is metrically complete if and only if geodesics
extend indefinitely unless they hit the boundary.
(iii) It follows from Assumption 4 that the developing map descends to a
function dev : M → Tp M ∼
= R2 , for a reference point p ∈ M. Indeed,
for q ∈ M let γ be a curve in M connecting p to q. Then
Z
dev(q) = Πpγ(t) (γ̇(t)) dt.

(iv)
(v)

(vi)

(vii)
(viii)

The triviality of monodromy implies that this integral does not depend
on the chosen curve.
By Proposition 3.5 dev is a locally affine map (also a local isometry),
and in particular, a local diffeomorphism in Int(M).
Even though ∂M is homeomorphic to a circle, its image under dev
is not necessarily a simple curve. Let L ⊂ R2 be an open disc that
contains dev(∂M), and let K = dev−1 (L).
K is bounded and connected by the following argument: By completeness and connectedness of M, and a version of Hopf-Rinow for manifolds with boundary, any point of M and, in particular, any point of K
can be connected to ∂M by a geodesic γ. Since dev is locally affine by
step (iv), it follows that γ̄ = dev ◦γ is a geodesic. Since L is convex,
and the endpoints of γ̄ belong to L, we conclude that γ̄ ⊂ L. Thus the
length of γ̄ is less than the diameter of L. It follows that the length of
γ is also less than the diameter of L. So, the distance from any point
of K to ∂M is bounded. Moreover, ∂M is compact by assumption 3
and thus bounded. Therefore, K is bounded as claimed. Similarly,
the fact that γ̄ ⊂ L implies that γ ⊂ K. So any point in K can be
connected within K to a point of ∂M. Moreover, ∂M is connected by
assumption 3. So K is connected as claimed.
K is compact because it is closed and bounded.
It follows from step (iv) and the Implicit Function Theorem that K is
a manifold with boundary and
∂K = ∂M ∪ dev−1 (∂L).
42

In particular, ∂K is a union of circles.
(ix) M \ K is complete because it is a closed subset of a complete manifold.

is a covering map; denote by d the degree of the covering.
∂(M \ K) is closed and bounded hence compact.
It follows from the classification of covering spaces together with the
previous step that M \ K is a union of annuli.
The second homology group H2 (M) vanishes by the following argument:
The interior of M is non-compact, so Proposition 3.29 from [13] implies
its second homology is trivial. But M is homotopy equivalent to its
interior, so its homology is the same.
It follows from the previous step and a Mayer-Vietoris argument that
H1 (K) ' Z.
By classification of surfaces, K is a (single) annulus.
By the previous step, ∂K is a union of two circles. So, by step (viii)
we have ∂(M \ K) ' S 1 .
Hence M \ K is an annulus.
Since M is the union of two annuli, M \ K and K, along their joint
boundary, it follows that M is an annulus.
Let γ be a simple closed curve in R2 \ L. It has winding number one.
Let γ d be the concatenation of γ with itself d times; it has winding
number d.
Let γ̃ be a lifting of γ d to M \ K, i.e., dev ◦γ̃ = γ d . Then by covering
space theory, γ̃ is a simple closed curve that generates π1 (M ) ' Z.
Moreover, since lifting preserves winding number, the winding number
of γ̃ is d.
By classification of simple closed curves on an annulus (compare with
the case of the torus in Chapter 1 of [10]), every two non-contractible
simple closed curves on a annulus are homotopic. By Proposition 1.10
of [10], every two simple closed curves in a surface that are homotopic
are also isotopic. Together with Assumption 5 it follows that γ̃ is
isotopic to a curve that has winding number one, hence d = 1.
Since dev is a covering of degree one it is bijective. A bijective map
that is locally affine is an affine embedding; this concludes the proof.

4.6

Point defects

We next briefly consider point defects, i.e., manifolds in which the locus of
the defect is a point, or a finite collection of points. In three dimensions, M is
simply connected, which implies a trivial fundamental group, and therefore a
trivial monodromy. The implication is that point defects cannot be detected
in the same way as line defects, by making metric measurements around
loops that encircle the defect.
Consider, for example, a point defect of type vacancy. The Volterra cutand-weld procedure in this case would be to remove from R3 a ball of radius
a (say, centered at the origin) and weld the boundary of this ball into a single
point. M. Here we take M = R3 \ {0}, which we parametrize using spherical
coordinates,
(R, Θ, Φ) ∈ (0, ∞) × [0, π] × [0, 2π),
and the metric is
g = dR ⊗ dR + (R + a)2 dΘ ⊗ dΘ + (R + a)2 sin2 Θ dΦ ⊗ dΦ,
The vacancy manifests in that the intrinsic geometry in its vicinity has “too
much length”; the surface area of spheres that converge to a single point—the
locus of the defect—does not tend to zero.
Here too, like for the two-dimensional defects considered in the last subsection, the trivial monodromy manifests itself in the fact that if a compact
set that contains the locus of the defect is removed, the punctured manifold
embeds isometrically in Euclidean space.

Discussion

This paper is concerned with the description of singular defects in isotropic
media. The geometric structure of such materials is fully encoded in their
reference metric. We showed that topological defects can be fully described
by geometric fields that only reflect the metric structure. More specifically,
topological defects are described by the affine structure induced by the locally Euclidean metric. In particular, dislocations are described by the affine
structure without reference to torsion.
44

It is important to stress that our approach does not contradict former approaches. As showed by Wang almost 50 years ago, non-Riemannian material
connection arise naturally in media that exhibit discrete symmetries. Our
statement is that the “failure of parallelograms to be closed” can be fully captured in isotropic media by the translational part of the monodromy, which
only depends on the postulated affine structure. Note that the moment that
topological defects are encoded by a metric, they can be realized without
the need to break any structure. For example, both disclinations and edge
dislocations can be created by imposing a two-dimensional reference metric
via differential swelling, as in [15], with a swelling factor that is harmonic
everywhere but at a finite number of points.
Another interesting observation is the relation between disclinations and
dislocations as monopoles and dipoles of curvature charges, and their electrostatic analog. Like in the electrostatic analog, the dipole moment, is
independent of the reference point if and only if the monopole moment vanishes, thus answering the question raised by Miri and Rivier [21] about the
coexistence of disclinations and dislocations. Yet, unlike in the electrostatic
analog, the dipole moment (reflected by the translational part of the monodromy) can be calculated exactly, and not just asymptotically at infinity,
by metric measurements around loops that encircle the locus of the defect.
In this respect, the nonlinear Laplace equation that connects the metric to
the Gaussian curvature turns out to be “simpler” than the linear Poisson
equation in electrostatics.
Another result of the present paper is that every two-dimensional metric
that has trivial monodromy can be isometrically embedded in the plane, up to
the possible need to exclude a compact subset. In practical terms, this means
that every defective plane in which the defect cannot be detected by metric
measurements along a curve that encircles the locus of the defect can be
embedded in Euclidean plane with metric distortions restricted to a compact
set. This observation, which is relevant for example to known defects in
graphene, has immediate implications on the elastic energy associated with
such defects.
Our paper is concerned with the description of defects, and does not
present calculations of residual stresses in bodies with defects. To calculate
stresses one needs a concrete model, e.g., a neo-Hookean solid as used in [28],
with strain measured relative to the postulated reference metric.
