Introduction

Research in knowledge-based decision systems
(KBDS) combines artificial intelligence and decision
analysis techniques to solve problems involving choice
and uncertainty. The dynamic decision-modeling ap­
proach in KBDS advocates that the decision mod­
els for different problems should be dynamically con­
structed from a knowledge base [Breese, 1989, Well­
man, 1990a]. This approach facilitates scalability and
reusability of the knowledge bases. Moreover, the re­
sulting decision models are context-sensitive and in­
clude only the relevant information specific to the
problems. To date, however, while much progress has
been made in improving the algorithms for manipulat­
ing decision models, the automated model construc­
tion process remains to be formalized.
This paper characterizes the knowledge for supporting
dynamic decision-modeling in medicine. Character­
izing such knowledge illuminates the representational
and computational requirements for automating deci­
sion analysis in a broad domain. Unlike previous ef­
forts, instead of concentrating on the structural com­
ponents of the decision model such as nodes, condi­
tional probabilities, and influences, we focus on the
ontological features of the decision problem such as
contexts, classes of observed events, classes of available
actions, classes of possible outcomes, temporal prece­
dence, and probabilistic and contextual dependencies.

By gaining insights into the nature of decisions, this
exercise serves as a step toward developing a formal
methodology for requirement analysis and realizing a
uniform representation framework for supporting dy­
namic decision-modeling in KBDS.
The following discussions are based on the general sys­
tem architecture depicted in Figure 1. Given a prob­
lem description, the planner or decision-maker con­
structs a decision model by accessing information con­
tained in the knowledge base. The domain and the
decision-analytic components of the knowledge base
are integrated by the knowledge-base manager, which
also serves as an interface to the planner.
The decision models considered are qualitative prob­
abilistic networks (QPNs) [Wellman, 1990b). Since
QPNs are the qualitative variants of influence dia­
grams, and since each influence diagram can be trans­
formed into a decision tree, our results are expected to
be generalizable to other decision models.

80 year old, female
Fainting, arrythmia

The patient is an 80 year-old woman. She complained
of fainting and was found to have irregular heartbeats,
or arrythmia. A diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, i.e., dis­
order of the heart muscles was made. Such a disorder
usually leads to embolism, or formation of blood clots
in the patient's body. The problem is to determine if
anticoagulant therapy should be administered to reduce
the chance of embolism, given the high risk of bleeding
complications in the elderly.
Each relevant event in the decision problem can be re­
garded as a concept, e.g., SO-year-old, cardiomyopathy,
anticoagulant-therapy, etc. A concept is an event or a
random variable in the probabilistic sense; it denotes
an abstract description of an object, an attribute, a
state of being or a process, depending on the circum­
stances.

The Decision Making Process

Given a set of input concepts, the goal for the proposed
KBDS is to construct a decision model such as the one
shown in Figure 2, and then evaluate the feasibility of
the alternatives with respect to some criteria,e.g., life­
expectancy, expected monetary value, etc.
More formally, the decision-analytic approach to de­
cision making can be viewed as a five-step process:
1) Background characterization; 2) context establish­
ment; 3) problem formulation; 4) model construction;
and 5) Model evaluation.
3.1

Background Information
Characterization

The process begins by classifying the input concepts
into the variables concerned, the actions available, and
the possible outcomes involved in a decision problem.
In the clinical setting, the input concepts can usually
be divided into six categories, as shown in Table 1 for
our example.
The planner can characterize each input concept by
asking questions like:
•
•

Is fainting a kind of sign or symptom?
Is cardiomyopathy a kind of disease?

To answer the above queries, the knowledge-base must
support categorizations of the relevant domain con­
cepts. A categorization is a grouping of concepts with
similar descriptions in a particular dimension. Ex­
amples of such groupings include those induced by
the specialization (AKO) relation, the decomposition
(PARTOF) relation, etc.

Cardiomyopathy
Anticoagulant-therapy
Embolism, bleeding

The characterized background information, however,
is insufficient for formulating a decision model. For
instance, in our example, the relationships among the
input concepts are not explicitly stated, the two rel­
evant kinds of embolism being considered, systemic
and pulmonary embolisms, are not specified, and the
evaluation criteria are not mentioned. The missing in­
formation, which may be related to the domain or the
decision-analytic methodology, must be derived when
necessary.
3.2

Domain Context Establishment

Establishing the context 1 means defining the task en­
vironment in which the problem is to be solved. This
enables different problem situations to be considered
and sets limits on the possible operations that can be
applied to a given problem [Kassirer and Kopelman,
1987). The context is selected with only a few clues
[ Kassirer and Garry, 1978). In the clinical setting, a
context is usually indicated by a suspected disease, a
syndrome, i.e., a set of signs and symptoms that con­
vey special meanings, or a general diagnostic category,
e.g., an acute respiratory disorder [ Kassirer and Kopel­
man, 1987).
In our example, the clinical context is "cardiomyopa­
thy in old-age." This context is established by iden­
tifying the suspected diseases and any conditions that
might significantly affect their nature.
Given the characterized background information, iden­
tifying the suspected diseases simply involves looking
them up in the set of input concepts. For now, we as­
sume that other significant conditions, e.g., old-age in
our example, are specified by an oracle. Recognizing
these conditions automatically requires a very sophis­
ticated planner, and the issues involved are outside the
scope of this paper.
The main purpose of establishing a context is to al1 This

constraints, variables, and alternatives considered in the
decision problem.

low access to the context-sensitive information. For
instance, in older patients, cardiomyopathy may have
different manifestations and more severe complications
than in younger patients, or in the presence of other
diseases. Therefore, such context-sensitive knowledge
must be expressible in the knowledge base.
3.3

Decision Problem Formulation

Guided by the characterized background information,
a decision problem is formulated within the domain
context by identifying:
•

•
•

•
•

•

all or the most important diseases/hypotheses
that may be involved;
the relative significance of all these concepts;
all
or
the
most
important
possible
outcomes/ complications of these concepts;
all or the most important actions available;
the effects of the actions on the concepts and their
outcomes and possible complications; and
the evaluation criteria.

Table 2 shows all the relevant concepts in our exam­
ple. "Pulmonary embolism" and "systemic embolism"
are among the values of the corresponding "embolism"
node in Figure 2.

Table 2: Concepts Involved in Decision Problem
Old-age
Cardiomyopathy
Fainting
Arrythmia
Embolism
Pulmonary-embolism
Systemic-embolism

Anticoagulant-therapy
Bleeding
Long-term-morbidity
Short-term-morbidity
Mortality
Quality-adjustedlife-expectancy

These concepts are derived by asking questions like:
•

What are the most common embolisms caused by
cardiomyopathy?

•

What are the other (if any) complications of
anticoagulant-therapy?

To answer the above queries, the knowledge base
must, in addition to supporting categorizations of
the domain concepts, allow expression of the inter­
actions, i.e., the correlational/influential/causal rela­
tions, among these concepts. The varying degrees
of significance for all these relations in different con-

Representation Requirements for Supporting Decision Model furmulation

texts must also be expressible in the knowledge base.
This, together with the varying degrees of temporal
and probabilistic dependencies among the interactions,
would facilitate derivation of the most relevant infor­
mation for the problem at hand.
3.4

Decision Model Construction

As mentioned, a decision model for our example is
shown in Figure 2.
To construct such a decision model, its structure, e.g.,
nodes and links in a QPN, and its preference model,
e.g., evaluation criteria such as morbidity, mortality,
and monetary costs associated with utilities, must be
inferrable from the knowledge base. The temporal con­
straints on the decision model structure, i.e., the or­
der in which the concepts and their consequences are
to be considered, should also be inferrable from the
interactions of the underlying concepts. Hence, the
construction involves asking questions like:
•

•

How are the observable effects of the alternatives
relate to the chance events?
What are the outcomes that affect the evaluation
criteria?

To support these queries, the relevant interactions
among the concepts must be expressible in the knowl­
edge base. These interactions involve both domain
concepts and decision-analytic concepts, e.g., "pres­
ence of disease positively-influences morbidity."
3.5

Decision Model Evaluation

Upon completion, the decision model is evaluated by
some procedure with respect to the evaluation criteria.
Here, evaluation of a decision model refers to solving
the model with procedures such as folding back of a
decision tree, or graph reduction of a QPN. The eval­
uation criterion assumed in our example is quality­
adjusted life expectancy, i.e., a measure of time re­
maining in a patient's life, taking into account the in­
conveniences caused by the illness (morbidity). Given
a well-formed decision model, only procedural knowl­
edge is needed in this step.
Summary of Inference Patterns and

4

Representation Requirements

The above analysis shows that four types of general
inference patterns are involved in the automated deci­
sion analysis process:
•
•

•

(Ql) Does concept A related to concept B in 0
(Q2) What are the concepts related to concept A
in 0?
(Q3) Does concept A relate to concept B by i?

•

(Q4) What are the concepts related to concept A
by i?

where 0 is a categorization and i is an interaction.
Three types of knowledge are required to support these
inferences: categorical knowledge, uncertain knowl­
edge, and a notion of "context."
4.1

Categorical Knowledge

The categorical knowledge captures the definitional or
structural relations of the concepts, allowing expres­
sion of facts such as: "cardiomyopathy is a kind of
disease" and "pulmonary embolism is a kind of em­
bolism." This type of knowledge should provide the
system with the power of abstraction and inheritance.
In other words, knowing a class of concepts would al­
low the planner to derive its subclasses, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the generic description for a class of con­
cepts can be specified at an appropriate level of ab­
straction; portions of this description can be inherita­
ble by its subclasses or superclasses.
4.2

Uncertain Knowledge

The uncertain knowledge captures the interactions,
i.e., the correlational, influential, or causal relations
among the concepts, allowing expression of facts such
as: "presence of anticoagulant-therapy negatively­
influences presence of embolism" and "cardiomyopa­
thy causes arrythmia." This type of knowledge should
provide the system with the power of differentiation
by accommodating a spectrum of temporal and prob­
abilistic dependencies among the concepts. By com­
paring the relational strengths, the planner would be
able to deduce the certainty and usefulness of the in­
formation derived from the knowledge base.
4.3

A Contextual Notion

In addition to the categorical and uncertain knowl­
edge, a notion of "context" should be included in the
knowledge base. This contextual notion has the fol­
lowing properties:
1. It sets a boundary on the relevant categorical and
uncertain knowledge, and can be regarded as a
focusing mechanism. This enables the planner
to look for different information in different sit­
uations. For instance, the old-age of a patient
would lead to the focus on a particular set of com­
plications for cardiomyopathy and anticoagulant­
therapy.
2. It allows differentiation of the relational signifi­
cance, both categorical and interactional, among
a set of concepts; the relative relevance and im­
portance of the information can thus be dis­
tinguished in different situations. For example,

215

216

Leong

bleeding is the most important complication of
anticoagulant-therapy in the context of cardiomy­
opathy in old-age.
3. It is compositional and can be defined hierarchi­
cally. In other words, multiple, interacting con­
texts may coexist and a context can be defined
within another context. For example, "cardiomy­
opathy" and "old-age" combine to form the con­
text of "cardiomyopathy in old-age"; the latter,
in turn, is a subcontext of "disease in old-age."
5

A Representation Design

We now propose a representation design that would
meet the requirements for supporting the inferences
Ql-Q4 in a context-sensitive manner.
5.1

Representation of Concepts

In our framework, a concept is an intensional descrip­
tion of the relational interpretation of an object, a
state, a process, or an attribute of these phenom­
ena. In other words, a concept reflects the salient
features of the underlying phenomenon through a
set of interactions with other concepts. These rel­
evant concepts are called the properties of the con­
cept being described. For example, the description
of the concept disease2 includes properties such as
severity, manifestation, and treatment, as well
as interactions such as "presence-of-disease causes
and
presence-of-manifestation-of-disease"
''presence-of-treatment-of-disease
negatively­
influences severity-of-disease."
5.1.1

Properties of Concepts

The properties of a concept include its inherent qual­
ities, characteristics, and other relevant concepts that
constitute its description e.g., size (of a tumor)
and treatment (of a disease). Each property is a
concept3 itself. Each property of a concept has a list
of values, which are also concepts themselves.
To incorporate context-dependent information, a
new concept can be derived from each prop­
erty of a concept.
For example, the concept
treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is derived from the
property treatment of cardiomyopathy. This new
derived-concept has a description constrained by
the concept it is derived from; the two concepts
are related by the context (CXT) relation to be
described below.
Compositions of the CXT re­
lation enable "chaining" of the derived-concepts,
e.g., duration-of-treatment-of-cardiomyopathy,

formable in this way.

, are concepts

The properties of a concept in this framework are
analogous to the roles in term subsumption languages
and the slots in frame-based languages. The dif­
ference is that the properties alone do not com­
pletely describe a concept; they serve only as in­
dices to the interactions that constitute the mean­
ing of a concept. These interactions are expressed
in terms of the corresponding derived-concepts,
e.g., "duration-of-treatment-of-cardiomyopathy
negatively-influences severity-of-cardiomyopathy
is an interaction in the description of cardiomyopathy.
5.1.2

Interactions of Concepts

Each interaction between two concepts has two com­
ponents: temporal precedence, with "known" or "un­
known" as values, and qualitative probabilistic influ­
ence [Wellman, 1990b], with "positive," "negative,"
and "unknown" as values. The interactions can thus
be expressed as four types of links in a network in­
terpretation of our framework: associational links,
which denote probabilistic correlation with an un­
known type of influence and unknown temporal prece­
dence; precedence links, which denote temporal prece­
dence with unknown type of probabilistic influence; in­
fluential links, which denote conditional probabilistic
dependencies; and causal/inhibitive links, which de­
note known temporal precedence in addition to known
type of probabilistic influences.
5.2

Categorization of Concepts

The description of a concept can be constrained by a
set of categorizers. A categorizer is a categorical or
class relationship; it is a binary relation that speci­
fies the properties and the interactions of a concept in
terms of those of another concept. By imposing a par­
tial order on the related concepts, a categorizer estab­
lishes a unique perspective for describing each concept.
For example, a concept can be described as "a kind of'
another concept or "a part of' another concept. Some
common categorizers include the specialization (AKO)
relation, the decomposition (PARTOF) relation, and the
equivalence (EQV) relation.
All the concepts related by a categorizer are said to be
in a categorization; some categorizations have hierar­
chical interpretations, while others are more naturally
seen as networks. By knowing the position of a par­
ticular concept with respect to another concept in a
categorization, the description of the former can be
inferred from the latter. This descriptive inference in
a categorization is called inheritance.
For instance, the specialization relation can be defined
as follows:

Representation Requirements for S\lpporting Decision Model Furmulation

all concepts. Let 0 be the set of categorizers. Let Ow �
C be the set of concepts in a categorization related by

Two major properties are observed for the AKO cate­
gorizer:

1. a E 0AKO <==> 3b,(a,b) E AKO or (b, a) E
AKO.
2. The AKO relation is irreflexive, 88ymmetric, and
transitive.
3. The properties and interactions of the concepts
are downward inheritable in the specialization hi­
erarchy.
5.3

Context-Dependent Representation

The categorizers establish some general perspec­
For example, a
tives for describing a concept.
pulmonary-embolism is a kind of embolism in general.
The description of a concept in these general perspec­
tives is further constrained by a set of contexts.
A context (CXT) relation can be thought of 88 a
"meta-categorizer;" it is a binary relation that spec­
ifies the properties and the interactions of, and
hence also the categorizers on a concept in ac­
cordance with those of another concept.
For
example, treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is speci­
fied 88 a kind of treatment-of-disease because
treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is defined in the con­
text of cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy is a
kind of disease. All concepts are described in some
contexts; the descriptions that are valid in general are
in the universal context. Therefore, the (CXT) relation
facilitates representation of context-sensitive informa­
tion, 88 mentioned earlier, by allowing chaining of
derived-concepts and constraining their descriptions.
The partial-ordering imposed by this relation forms a
context-hierarchy of all the concepts in the knowledge
b88e.

Supporting General Inferences

B88ed on the above representation framework, we shall
now discuss how the knowledge base of the proposed
KBDS would provide answers for the inferences Ql­

2. Let 0 = {AKO,...}=the set of all categorizers.

An example Q4 query is: Does cardioJDyopathy relate

For simplicity, all the answers to the above inferences
assume a closed world assumption, i.e., a negative
answer will be returned if a relation is not explic­
itly derivable from the knowledge base. The context­
sensitivity of the answers, though not very obvious, is
actually inherent from the underlying representation.
7

Related Work

The major shortcomings of the static decision­
modeling approach, i.e., treating pre-enumerated de­
cision models or templates as knowledge bases, result
from the rigidity of the knowledge bases. Constrained
by the structure of the decision models, e.g., nodes and
links of a decision tree, such knowledge bases do not
reflect the nature of the domain knowledge.
The different representations used in existing KBDS
with the dynamic decision-modeling approach are not
very satisfactory, either. The first order logic-like
representations, such as those employed by Breese
[1987, 1989], and Goldman and Charniak [1990], have
no explicit hierarchical dimensions. In these frame­
works, multi-level decision models are created by ac­
tivation of a set of rules; limited contextual informa­
tion is captured as conditional probabilities matrices
in these rules.
In Wellman's [1990a] SUDO-PLANNER system, do­
main descriptions can be expressed in multiple levels of
precision in this framework, thus facilitating decision­
modeling in multiple levels of abstraction. The ter­
minological component of this framework, however, is
subjected to the limited expressiveness of most term
subsumption languages. Moreover, the purely proba­
bilistic nature of the effects or influences does not re­
flect the varying degrees of significance among the con­
cepts with respect to the problem at hand. Although
some contextual effects on the influences can be ex­
pressed in the qualitative synergies defined in QPN,
there is no general mechanism for capturing contex­
tual information in the whole framework.
Other relevant representation formalisms include those
that incorporate an uncertainty model to a hierarchical
representation framework. Most hierarchical represen­
tations are designed to support derivation of absolute
or categorical answers. To support approximate rea­
soning, i.e., finding out facts that are not absolutely
true or false, but believed to a certain degree, some
efforts attempt to accommodate an uncertainty model
by re-interpreting the semantics of a categorical repre­
sentation, while others try to couple the two to form

a coherent framework.
For instance, in the network representation developed
by Lin and Goebel [1990], both subsumption and
causal relationships are expressible. Probabilistic in­
terpretations are given to parts of the causal network,
called the scenarios. These scenarios can be consid­
ered as contexts with different probability distribu­
tions. Although the scenarios are not hierarchically
arranged, their probabilistic rankings are preserved
across the subsumption relationships. Nevertheless,
this network formalism does not allow the properties,
and hence the nature of each node or concept to be
explicitly represented.
Yen and Bonissone's [1990] work attempts to general­
ize the semantics of term subsumption languages with
an approximate reasoning model, such as fuzzy logic
or possibility theory, to support plausible inferences.
Non-definitional relations among the concepts, how­
ever, are not expressible in these frameworks. There
is also no general notion of context-dependent defini­
tions.
Saffiotti's [1990] hybrid framework, on the other hand,
integrates a component that deals with absolute or cat­
egorical knowledge and another with the uncertainty of
this knowledge. Any formal representation formalism
and uncertainty model may constitute the two com­
ponents in the framework, e.g., first-order logic with
Dempster-Shafer theory, term subsumption language
with probability theory, etc. We believe this work is an
important step toward the theoretical foundations of
integrating categorical and uncertain know ledge. The
expressiveness and hence the usefulness of the frame­
work, however, depend solely on the component for­
malisms.

Discussion and Conclusion

To support dynamic decision-modeling, the structure
of the knowledge base must reflect the nature of both
the decision problem and the domain knowledge. In
particular, the underlying representation must neither
be restricted by the structural components of the de­
cision models, e.g., nodes and links of an influence di­
agram, nor their evaluation mechanisms, e.g., folding
back of a decision tree. By focusing on the ontology
of a decision problem, we have identified a set of infer­
ence patterns and knowledge types for supporting au­
tomated construction of decision models in medicine.
The brief survey on existing representations has shed
some light on a design approach for integrating cate­
gorical and uncertain knowledge in a context-sensitive
manner. We believe such an integration calls for a
framework with a terminological component, an asser­
tional component, and a network interpretation. By
capturing the context notion via partitioning the net­
work, this framework would allow us to establish tax-

Representation Requirements for Supporting Decision Model furmulation

onomies of structured concepts, state the facts, i.e., the
interactions among the concepts, and answer questions
about these relations.
We have sketched a design outline of such a repre­
sentation in this paper; a more detailed exposition is
described elsewhere [Leong, 1991]. Many important
issues, however, are yet to be explored. In partic­
ular, the notion of "context" needs to be more for­
mally defined, many interesting problems arise in the
context-sensitive inheritance patterns of the categor­
ical relations, and the context-sensitive probabilistic
semantics of the interactions needs to be generalized.
Careful examination of these issues, we believe, will
lead to the formalization of both the automated de­
cision model formulation process and the domain and
decision-analytic knowledge involved.
