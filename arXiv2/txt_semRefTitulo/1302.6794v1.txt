utility or value units of the problem. Other methods, such
as rank-order correlation, express importance in terms of
the correlation between an uncertain variable and the out­

EVI: What's so, and What's New

most of its input quantities are

invariably uncertain. Sensi­

Deterministic perturbation measures importance in utility

recommended decision.

One calculates EVPI (Expected Value of Perfect Infor·
mation) in discrete models by rolling back the decision

tree. The computation itself is straightforward in the sense

that, to compute EVI, one simply places at the front of the
tree the chance variables to be observed. The EVPI is
computed as the difference between the expected value
computed for this scenario and the expected value for the
regular tree, without observations.
Computing EVI with continuous variables is less intuitive,
because we have no tidy way of reversing the uncertainty,

a hard-to-assess, mongrel distribution. Assuming that the
xi are normal forces z to be normal also. If the x; are non­
normal, then we must make an extra approximating
assumption that z is normal also, although we must
emphasize that this assumption would not be analytically
true.
A limiting aspect of the technique presented here is that it
measures EVI relative to only two decisions. In [Chavez,

Application

We now describe an application of our method to a large
decision model developed at Rockwell's Palo Alto Science
Laboratory to support Course of Action (COA) analysis
for Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO).
Implemented in Demos, NEO-COA allows a user to
instantiate a generic NEO plan with specific parameter
values for locations, forces, and destinations of troops and
civilians. The model provides insights into the relative
strengths of alternative plans by scoring them using differ­
ent evaluation metrics, such as time to complete the opera­
tion. Because many of the elements of a real-world
military planning scenario are not known with certainty,
several of the model's inputs are specified as continuous
probability distributions.
In the current version of NEO-COA, there are three deci­
sion variables, or factors over which a military planner
exercises control:

126

Chavez and Henrion

on day 2 and 5 C-14l's on days 3 through 10" is an
example of a particular transportation configuration.
Because each of these decision variables currently possess
three alternatives, there are a total of 27 available courses
of action. In addition, the NEO-COA model possesses
over 100 different input variables; of those, currently nine
are specified as probabilistic quantities.
Once the decision variables and inputs have been speci­
fied, the model performs a dynamic simulation of the flow
of U.S. citizens (the non-combatants) from their starting
locations within a country to a set of selected assembly
areas, and then on to the safe havens. It also includes risk
factors associated with both U.S. citizens and U.S. mili­
tary personnel as functions of time. For example, risk to
U.S. citizens at the assembly areas can rise and fall over
the course of an entire operation in response to uncertain
events, such as the arrival of security forces. The func­
tional representations of the risk factors are then used to
compute expected casualties- civilian and military for varying alternatives.
A top level view of the NEO-COA model as implemented
in Demos is shown in Figure 4 . There are three uncertain­
ties for the NEO-COA model: Initial USCITS, proba bil ­
ity distributions on the number of U.S. citizens in each of
the three regions of the country (capital, north, and south)
at the start of a crisis planning operation; Country
Regions Attrition Risk, which is the risk posed to non­
combatants over the course of an operation; and Transfer
Rate, which is the speed at which civilians move from
their starting locations to the assembly areas. Thus a total
of nine continuous probability distributions must be
assigned; typically, these are subjective assessments pro­
vided by military planners using the model.
In Figure 5, we show the results of applying the EVI
approximation technique to the NEO model for perfect
information. We see, for example, that the uncertainty
about the number of American citizens in the capital has
EVI equal to about six lives, and the uncertainty about the
transfer rates in the capital has perfect information value
equal to more than seven lives. In all cases, the value of
information is highest for uncertainties relating to the cap­
ital region, reflecting that the highest number of citizens
are concentrated there. The integral in Eq. 4 is evaluated
numerically. Perfect information calculations on nine

uncertainties took Demos 1 minute, 53 seconds running on
a Macintosh Ilfx computer.

6.0 Conclusions and Future Directions
We have described a general analytic framework for esti­
mating EVI in a decision model using preposterior analy­
sis. It employs a linear-approximating assumption that
allows us to write the value function as a first-order equa­
tion in the inputs. We define variable z to be the difference
in value for the two decision alternatives. Multiple linear
regression on the inputs provides the necessary constants
for the linear value equation; we estimate the regression
constants from Monte Carlo sample information. Applying
preposterior analysis to z allows us to write an approxima­
tion to the value of perfect and partial information for any
combination of state variables.
There are several areas in which we plan to extend the
work presented here. First, we would like to develop a sis­
ter technique for approximating EVI on continuous deci­
sion variables. Second, we would like to examine how
well our technique performs relative to an exact, more
costly approach. To this end we will apply our method to
several large models, run it several times, and compare its
results to the corresponding exact answers. Third, we wilk
apply statistical proof techniques to analyze formally the
algorithm's convergence and error characteristics.
