The subject of this paper is the elucidation of effects of actions from causal assumptions represented as a directed graph, and statistical knowledge given as a probability distribution. In particular, we are interested in predicting distributions on post-action outcomes given a set of measurements. We provide a necessary and sufficient
graphical condition for the cases where such distributions can be uniquely computed from the
available information, as well as an algorithm
which performs this computation whenever the
condition holds. Furthermore, we use our results to prove completeness of do-calculus [Pearl,
1995] for the same identification problem, and
show applications to sequential decision making.

Introduction

This paper deals with computing effects of actions in domains represented as causal diagrams, or graphs with directed and bidirected arcs. Such diagrams contain vertices
corresponding to variables of interest, directed arcs representing potential direct causal relationships, and bidirected
arcs which are spurious correlations or ’hidden common
causes’ [Pearl, 1995], [Pearl, 2000]. Aside from this kind
of causal knowledge represented by the graph, we also have
statistical knowledge about the variables in the model, represented by a joint probability distribution P .
An action on a set of variables X consists of forcing the
variables to particular values x regardless of the value X
would have otherwise attained. This action, denoted by
do(x) in [Pearl, 2000], transforms the original distribution
P into an interventional distribution denoted by Px . We
quantify the effect of the action do(x) on a set Y by considering Px (y). In this paper, we also consider conditional
effects of the form Px (y|z), which correspond to the effect
of do(x) on Y in a situation where it is known that z holds.

The problem of causal ef f ect identif iability consists
of finding graphs in which effects represented by Px (y)
or Px (y|z) can be uniquely determined from the original
distribution P . It is well known that in causal diagrams
with no bidirected arcs, corresponding to Markovian models, all effects are identifiable [Pearl, 2000]. The situation is
more complicated in causal diagrams containing bidirected
arcs, and the corresponding models which are called semiMarkovian. Consider the graphs in Fig. 1. Here Px (y) is
not identifiable in G in Fig. 1 (a), but identifiable and equal
to P (y) in G′ in Fig. 1 (b).
Conditioning can both help and hinder identifiability. In the
graph G, conditioning on Z renders Y independent of any
changes to X, making Px (y|z) equal to P (y|z). On the
other hand, in G′ , conditioning on Z makes X and Y dependent, resulting in Px (y|z) becoming non-identifiable.
The past decade has yielded several sufficient conditions
for identifiability in the semi-Markovian case [Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines, 1993], [Pearl & Robins, 1995], [Pearl,
1995], [Kuroki & Miyakawa, 1999]. An overview of this
work can be found in [Pearl, 2000]. Generally, sufficiency
results for this problem rely on the causal and probabilistic assumptions embedded in the graph, and are phrased as
graphical criteria. For example, it is known that whenever
a set Z of non-descendants of X blocks
certain paths in the
P
graph from X to Y, then Px (y) = z P (y|z, x)P (z) [Pearl,
2000].
Identification of causal effects can also be deduced by
algebraic methods. [Pearl, 1995] provided 3 rules of
do-calculus, which systematically use properties of the
graph to manipulate interventional distribution expressions. These manipulations can be applied until the effect
is reduced to something computable from P . Similarly,
[Halpern, 2000] constructed a system of axioms and inference rules which can frame the identification problem as
one of theorem proving. The axiom set was then shown to
be complete. Algebraic methods such as these have the disadvantage of requiring the user to come up with a proof
strategy to show identifiability in any given case, rather
than giving an explicit graphical criterion.

A number of necessity results have recently been derived
as well. One such result [Tian & Pearl, 2002] states that Px
is identifiable if and only if there is no path consisting entirely of bidirected arcs from X to a child of X. A recent
paper [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006] constructed a complete algorithm for identifying Px (y), and showed do-calculus and
a version of Tian’s algorithm [Tian, 2002] to be complete
for the same identification problem. The last result is also
shown in [Huang & Valtorta, 2006]. A general algorithm
for identifying Px (y|z) has been proposed in [Tian, 2004].
Unfortunately, as we will later show, the algorithm has its
limitations.
In this paper, we use the above necessity results to solve the
problem of identifying conditional distributions Px (y|z).
We show a way to reduce this problem to identifying
unconditional distributions of the form Px′ (y′ ), for which
complete criteria and algorithms are already known. We
then use this reduction to give a complete graphical criterion for identification of conditional effects, and a complete
algorithm which returns an expression for such an effect in
terms of P whenever the criterion holds. We use our results to prove completeness of do-calculus [Pearl, 1995] for
identifying conditional effects.

Motivation: Sequential Decisions

Our interest in conditional interventional distributions can
be motivated by their relationship to sequential decision
problems that arise in many domains [Pearl & Robins,
1995]. We will use an example from treatment management in medicine. A patient comes in, complaining of a set
of symptoms Z0 . After administering some tests Z1 of his
own, the doctor prescribes a treatment X 1 = g1 (Z0 , Z1 ).
After a time, additional tests Z2 are done to check for medication side effects, patient improvement, complications,
and so on. Possibly a followup treatment X 2 = g2 (Z2 , X 1 )
is prescribed. In general, the treatment X i at time i is
a function of treatment history X<i and observation history Z<i . The treatment process continues until the patient
gets well or dies – represented by the state of outcome
variables Y. Note that in this situation, the doctor performs interventions do(xi ), but the specific values of the
treatment variables are not known in advance, but instead
depend on symptoms and test results performed ’on the fly’
via policy functions gi .

The effect of this kind of conditional policy g = {gi |i =
1, ..., K} is represented as the probability distribution on Y
given that the treatment variables X = {X i |i = 1, ..., K}
are fixed according to g. We write this is P (YXg ). To evaluate the efficacy of g, it would be useful to determine
P (YXg ) from statistical data available to the hospital regarding similar cases in the past, rather than resorting to
testing the policy on the patient. Note that this effect is a
complex counterfactual quantity because observation history Z<i and treatment history X<i are mutually dependent (by either g, or the normal causative mechanisms in
the model). NeverthelessSit can be shown that by doing
case analysis on Z = i Zi , we can obtain P (yXg ) =
P
z Pxz (y|z)Pxz (z), where xz is the treatment prescribed
given that Z is observed to be z. The key observation is
that since the policy g is known in advance, fixing z determines xz in advance as well. Thus, the effect of sequential
conditional plans can be identified from data if we can find
a way of identifying conditional distributions of the form
Px (y|z).

Notation and Definitions

In this section we reproduce the technical definitions
needed for the rest of the paper. We will denote variables
by capital letters, and their values by small letters. Similarly, sets of variables will be denoted by bold capital letters, and sets of values by bold small letters. We will use
some graph-theoretic abbreviations: P a(Y)G , An(Y)G ,
and De(Y)G will denote the set of (observable) parents,
ancestors, and descendants of the node set Y in G, respectively. We will omit the graph subscript if the graph
in question is assumed or obvious. We will denote the set
{X ∈ G|De(X)G = ∅} as the root set of G. Finally, following [Pearl, 2000], we will denote Gxy to be an edge
subgraph of G where all incoming arrows into X and all
outgoing arrows from Y are deleted.
Having fixed our notation, we can proceed to formalize the
notions discussed in the previous section. A probabilistic
causal model is a tuple M = hU, V, F, P (U)i, where V
is a set of observable variables, U is a set of unobservable
variables distributed according to P (U), and F is a set of
functions. Each variable V ∈ V has a corresponding function fV ∈ F that determines the value of V in terms of
other variables in V and U. The distribution on V induced
by P (U) and F will be denoted P (V).
Sometimes it is assumed P (V) is a positive distribution.
In this paper we do not make this assumption. Thus, we
must make sure that for every distribution P (W|Z) that we
consider, P (Z) is positive. This can be achieved by making sure to sum over events with positive probability only,
and by only considering observations with positive probability. Furthermore, for any action do(x) that we consider,
it must be the case that P (x|P a(X)G \ X) > 0 otherwise

the distribution Px (V) is not well defined [Pearl, 2000]. Finally, because Px (y|z) = Px (y, z)/Px (z), we must make
sure that Px (z) > 0.
The induced graph G of a causal model M contains a node
for every element in V, a directed edge between nodes X
and Y if fY possibly uses the values of X directly to determine the value of Y , and a bidirected edge between nodes
X and Y if fX and fY both possibly use the value of some
variable in U to determine their respective values. In this
paper we consider recursive causal models, those models
which induce acyclic graphs.
In any causal model there is a relationship between
its induced graph G and P , where P (x1 , ..., xn ) =
Q
∗
∗
i P (xi |pa (Xi )G ), and P a (.)G also includes unobservable parents [Pearl, 2000]. Whenever this relationship
holds, we say that G is an I-map (independence map) of
P . The I-map relationship allows us to link independence
properties of P to G by using the following well-known
notion of path separation [Pearl, 1988].

context z such that Y, X, Z are disjoint is said to be identifiable from P in G if Px (y|z) is (uniquely) computable from
P in any causal model which induces G.
Note that because Z can be empty, conditional effects generalize the more commonly used notion of effect as Px (y).
The following lemma establishes the conventional technique used to prove non-identifiability in a given G.
Lemma 1 Let X, Y, Z be sets of variables. Assume there
exist two causal models M 1 and M 2 with the same induced
graph G such that P 1 (V) = P 2 (V), P 1 (x|P a(X)G \ X) >
0, Px1 (z) > 0, Px2 (z) > 0, and Px1 (Y|z) 6= Px2 (Y|z). Then
Px (y|z) is not identifiable in G.
Throughout the paper, we will make use of 3 rules of docalculus [Pearl, 1995]. These identities, derived from Theorem 1, are known to hold for interventional distributions:

Rule 1: Px (y|z, w) = Px (y|w) if (Y ⊥
⊥ Z|X, W)GX

Definition 1 (d-separation) A path p in G is said to be dseparated by a set Z if and only if either

Rule 2: Px,z (y|w) = Px (y|z, w) if (Y ⊥
⊥ Z|X, W)GX,Z

1 p contains a chain I → M → J or fork I ← M → J,
such that M ∈ Z, or
2 p contains an inverted fork I → M ← J such that
De(M )G ∩ Z = ∅.
Two sets X, Y are said to be d-separated given Z in G if all
paths from X to Y in G are d-separated by Z. The following
well-known theorem links d-separation of vertex sets in an
I-map G with the independence of corresponding variable
sets in P .
Theorem 1 If sets X and Y are d-separated by Z in G, then
X⊥
⊥ Y|Z in every P for which G is an I-map.
A path that is not d-separated is said to be d − connected.
A d-connected path starting from a node X with an arrow
pointing to X is called a back − door path from X.
In the framework of causal models, actions are modifications of functional relationships. Each action do(x)
on a causal model M produces a new model Mx =
hU, V, Fx , P (U)i, where Fx , is obtained by replacing fX ∈
F for every X ∈ X with a new function that outputs a constant value x given by do(x). Note that Mx induces G \ X.
Since subscripts are used to denote submodels, we will use
numeric superscripts to enumerate models and their associated probability distributions (e.g. M 1 , P 1 ).
We can now define formally the notion of identifiability of
conditional effects from observational distributions.
Definition 2 (Causal Effect Identifiability) The causal
effect of an action do(x) on a set of variables Y in a given

Rule 3: Px,z (y|w) = Px (y|w) if (Y ⊥
⊥ Z|X, W)GX,Z∗
where Z∗ = Z \ An(W)GX .
Note that one way to restate rule 2 is to say that it holds for
a set Z whenever there are no back-door paths from Z to Y
given the action do(x) and observations w.

Hedges and Unconditional Effects

A previous paper [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006] provided a complete algorithm, and a corresponding graphical condition
for identification of all effects of the form Px (y). In this section, we will provide an overview of these results. We first
consider a set of nodes mutually interconnected by bidirected arcs.
Definition 3 (C-component) Let G be a semi-Markovian
graph such that a subset of its bidirected arcs forms a spanning tree over all vertices in G. Then G is a C-component
(confounded component).
Any causal diagram is either a C-component, or can
be uniquely partitioned into a set C(G) of maximal Ccomponents. C-components are an important notion for
identifiability and were studied at length in [Tian, 2002].
The importance of this structure stems from the fact that
the distribution P factorizes into a set of interventional
distributions according to C(G). For example the graph
in Fig. 1 (a) has two C-components, {X, Z} and {Y },
so P (x, y, z) = Px,z (y)Py (x, z). Furthermore, each term

in this factorization is identifiable. These observations allow one to decompose the identification problem into a set
of subproblems. We use C-components to define a graph
structure which turns out to be a key presence in all unidentifiable effects.
Definition 4 (C-forest) Let G be a semi-Markovian graph,
where Y is the root set. Then G is a Y-rooted C-f orest if all
nodes in G form a C-component, and all observable nodes
have at most one child.
If two C-forests share the same root set, and only one of
them contains any nodes in X, then the resulting graph
structure witnesses the non-identifiability of certain effects
of do(x). The structure in question is called a hedge.
Definition 5 (hedge) Let X, Y be sets of variables in G. Let
F, F ′ be R-rooted C-forests such that F ∩ X 6= ∅, F ′ ∩ X =
∅, F ′ ⊆ F , and R ⊂ An(Y)Gx . Then F and F ′ form a
hedge for Px (y).
Hedges precisely characterize non-identifiability of interventional joint distributions, as the following results show.
Theorem 2 Assume there exist R-rooted C-forests F, F ′
that form a hedge for Px (y) in G. Then Px (y) is not identifiable in G.

Proof: Consider the graph H = An(Y)G ∩ De(F )G , and
two models M 1 , M 2 which induce H. All variables in both
models are binary. In M 1 every variable is equal to the
bit parity of its parents. In M 2 the same is true, except all
nodes in F ′ disregard the parent values in F \ F ′ . All U are
fair coins in both models. It has been shown in [Shpitser
& Pearl, 2006] that M 1 and M 2 satisfy the conditions in
Lemma 1 for Px (y).
2
Theorem 3 (hedge criterion) Px (y) is identifiable from P
in G if and only if there does not exist a hedge for Px′ (y′ )
in G, for any X′ ⊆ X and Y′ ⊆ Y.
The proof can be found in [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006]. Whenever Px (y) is identifiable, we say that Px (y) does not contain any hedges. In such a case, the ID algorithm (pictured
in Fig. 2) computes the expression for Px (y) in terms of
P . It has also been shown in [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006] that
whenever Px (y) is not identifiable, ID returns the witnessing hedge, which entails the following result.
Theorem 4 ID is complete.
The previous results were also used to derive a completeness result for do-calculus
Theorem 5 The rules of do-calculus, together with standard probability manipulations are complete for determining identifiability of all effects of the form Px (y).
Proof: The proof, which reduces steps of the ID algorithm
to sequences of applications of do-calculus, can be found
in [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006].
2
Armed with a complete criterion and corresponding algorithm for identifying Px (y), we tackle the conditional version of the problem in the next section.

Identifiability of Conditional
Interventional Distributions

We now consider the problem of identifying distributions
of the form Px (y|w), where X, Y, W are arbitrary disjoint
sets of variables. Our approach will be to reduce this problem to a solved case where the set W is empty. One way to
accomplish this is to use rule 2 of do-calculus to transform
conditioning on W into interventions. Recall that whenever rule 2 applies to a set Z ⊆ W in G for Px (y|w) then
Px (y|w) = Px,z (y|w \ z). We want to use rule 2 in the most
efficient way possible and remove as many conditioning
variables as we can. The next lemma shows an application
of rule 2 on any set does not influence future applications
of the rule on other sets elsewhere in the graph.
Lemma 2 If rule 2 of do-calculus applies to a set Z in G
for Px (y|w) then there are no d-connected paths to Y that

pass through Z in neither G1 = G \ X given Z, W nor in
G2 = G \ (X ∪ Z) given W.
Proof: Clearly, there are no d-connected paths through Z in
G2 given W. Consider a d-connected path through Z ∈ Z
to Y in G1 , given Z, W. Note that this path must either
form a collider at Z or a collider which is an ancestor of Z.
But this must mean there is a back-door path from Z to Y,
which is impossible, since rule 2 is applicable to Z in G for
Px (y|w). Contradiction.
2

function IDC(y, x, z, P, G)
INPUT: x,y,z value assignments, P a probability
distribution, G a causal diagram (an I-map of P).
OUTPUT: Expression for Px (y|z) in terms of P or
FAIL(F,F’).
1 if (∃Z ∈ Z)(Y ⊥
⊥ Z|X, Z \ {Z})Gx,z ,
return IDC(y, x ∪ {z}, z \ {z}, P, G).
2 else let P ′ P
= ID(y ∪ z, x, P, G).
return P ′ / y P ′ .

The following is immediate.
Corollary 1 For any G and any conditional effect Px (y|w)
there exists a unique maximal set Z = {Z ∈ W|Px (y|w) =
Px,z (y|w \ {z})} such that rule 2 applies to Z in G for
Px (y|w).
Proof: Fix two maximal sets Z1 , Z2 ⊆ W such that rule 2
applies to Z1 , Z2 in G for Px (y|w). If Z1 6= Z2 , fix Z ∈
Z1 \ Z2 . By Lemma 2, rule 2 applies for {Z} ∪ Z2 in G for
Px (y|w), contradicting our assumption.
Thus if we fix G and Px (y|w), any set to which rule 2 applies must be a subset of the unique maximal set Z. It follows that Z = {Z ∈ W|Px (y|w) = Px,z (y|w \ {z})}. 2
This corollary states, in particular, that for any Px (y|w), we
can find a unique maximal set Z ⊆ W such that there are no
back-door paths from Z to Y given the context of the effect,
but there is such a back-door path from every W ∈ W \ Z
to Y.
However, even after a maximal number of nodes is removed from behind the conditioning bar using this corollary, we might still be left with a problem involving conditional distributions. The following key theorem helps us
relate this problem to the previously solved case.
Theorem 6 Let Z ⊆ W be the maximal set such that
Px (y|w) = Px,z (y|w \ z). Then Px (y|w) is identifiable in
G if and only if Px,z (y, w \ z) is identifiable in G.
Proof: See Appendix.

2

We can now put the results obtained so far together to construct a simple algorithm for identifiability of conditional
effects, shown in Fig. 3.
Theorem 7 (soundness) IDC is sound.
Proof: The soundness of the first line follows by rule 2
of do-calculus. The second line is just a standard conditional distribution calculation, coupled with an invocation
of an algorithm known to be sound from [Shpitser & Pearl,
2006].
2
We illustrate the operation of the algorithm by considering
the problem of identifying Px (y|z) in the graph G shown in
Fig. 1 (a). Because Y ⊥
⊥ Z|X, Z in Gx,z , rule 2 applies and

Figure 3: A complete identification algorithm for conditional effects.
we call the algorithm again with the expression Px,z (Y ).
This expression is an unconditional effect, so we call ID
as a subroutine. ID, in turn, succeeds immediately on line
6, returning the expression P (y|x, z), which we know is
equal to P (y|z) in G. Our results so far imply that IDC
will succeed on all identifiable conditional effects.
Theorem 8 (completeness) IDC is complete.
Proof: This follows from Theorem 4, Corollary 1 and Theorem 6.
2
With a complete algorithm for conditional effects, we can
graphically characterize all cases when such effects are
identifiable. To do this, we combine Theorem 6 to reduce
our problem to one of identifying unconditional effects, and
the hedge criterion, which is a complete graphical condition for such effects.
Corollary 2 (back-door hedge criterion) Let Z ⊆ W be
the unique maximal set such that Px (y|w) = Px,z (y|w \ z).
Then Px (y|w) is identifiable from P if and only if there does
not exist a hedge for Px′ (y′ ), for any Y′ ⊆ (Y ∪ W) \ Z,
X′ ⊆ X ∪ Z.
Proof: This follows from the hedge criterion and Theorem
6.
2
The name ’back-door hedge’ comes from the fact that both
back-door paths and hedge structures are key for identifiability of conditional effects. In particular, Px (y|w) is identifiable if and only if Px,z (y, w \ z) does not contain any
hedges and every W ∈ W \ Z has a back-door path to
some Y ∈ Y in the context of the effect.

Connections to Existing Algorithms

In this section, we explore the connection of our results
to existing identification algorithms for conditional effects.
One existing approach to identifying Px (y|w) consists of
repeatedly using probability manipulations and 3 rules of
do-calculus until the resulting expression does not involve

Theorem 9 The rules of do-calculus, together with standard probability manipulations are complete for determining all effects of the form Px (y|z).
Proof: The IDC algorithm consists of two stages, the
first corresponds to repeated applications of rule 2 of docalculus, and the second to identifying the effect of the
form Px (y). The result follows by Theorem 5.
2
We next consider an algorithm proposed in [Tian, 2004].
See Fig. 5. This algorithm generalizes an earlier algorithm
for unconditional effects [Tian, 2002] which was proven
complete in [Shpitser & Pearl, 2006], [Huang & Valtorta,
2006]. Unfortunately, as we now show, the version of the
algorithm for conditional effects is not sound.
Lemma 3 cond-identify is not sound.
Proof: Consider the graph G′′ in Fig. 1 (c). We will consider the conditional effect Px (w|z) in this graph. Note that
by the back-door hedge criterion this effect is not identifiable in G′′ .
We now trace through the execution of the algorithm for
Px (w|z). In this case, D = {Y, Z, W }, F = {Y }, C(G) =
{{X, Z}, {Y }{W }}, C(D) = {{Z}, {Y }, {W }}. Now
identification of Q[{Y }] and Q[{W }] trivially succeeds,
while identification of Q[{Z}] from Q[{Z, X}] fails.
Therefore, I = {{Y }, {W }}, N = {{Z}}, F0 = F . Because {Y } is not a parent of any identifiable C-component,
line 6 does nothing. Because F0 = F , line 8 does nothing.
However, {W }∩{Y } = ∅, so the algorithm succeeds. This
implies the result.

Conclusions

We have presented a complete graphical criterion for
identification of conditional interventional distributions in
semi-Markovian causal models. We used this criterion to
construct a sound and complete identification algorithm for
such distributions, and prove completeness of a do-calculus
for the same identification problem.
This work closes long standing questions about identifiability of interventional distributions, but much more remains to be done. Certain kinds of causal effects or counterfactual statements of interest cannot be expressed as an
interventional distribution. For instance, certain kinds of
direct and indirect effects [Pearl, 2001], and path-specific
effects are represented instead as a probability of a formula in a certain modal logic [Avin, Shpitser, & Pearl,
2005]. Questions about identifiability of such effects in
semi-Markovian models are an open problem for future
work.
