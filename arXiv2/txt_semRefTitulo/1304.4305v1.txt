. It is well-known that it is comparatively difficult to design nonconforming finite elements on quadrilateral meshes by using Gauss-Legendre points
on each edge of triangulations. One reason lies in that these degrees of freedom associated to these Gauss-Legendre points are not all linearly independent for usual
expected polynomial spaces, which explains why only several lower order nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements can be found in literature. The present paper proposes two families of nonconforming finite elements of any odd order and
one family of nonconforming finite elements of any even order on quadrilateral
meshes. Degrees of freedom are given for these elements, which are proved to be
well-defined for their corresponding shape function spaces in a unifying way. These
elements generalize three lower order nonconforming finite elements on quadrilaterals to any order. In addition, these nonconforming finite element spaces are
shown to be full spaces which is somehow not discussed for nonconforming finite
elements in literature before.

1. Introduction
Because of their flexibility and stability when compared with conforming finite element methods, nonconforming finite element methods have become very important
and effective discretization methods for numerically solving, among others, high
order elliptic problems, Stokes-like problems and Reissner-Mindlin plate bending
problems.
Quadrilateral meshes are very important in scientific and engineering computing.
Indeed, many popular softwares for computations of the fluid mechanics in two
dimensions are defined on quadrilateral meshes. However, most of nonconforming
finite element methods for second order problems are defined on triangles [1, 3, 4, 5,
7] while there are only a few nonconforming finite element methods on quadrilaterals.
Compared with nonconforming triangular finite elements, it is more difficult to
construct nonconforming quadrilateral finite elements. In fact, a sufficient condition
for convergence of consistency error terms is to require nonconforming functions to
be continuous at Gauss-Legendre points on interior edges of the triangulation used
[18, 19, 20, 21]. Hence, for m order nonconforming finite elements, there are 4m

Gauss-Legendre points on the boundary of each element. However, these degrees of
freedom on 4m Gauss-Legendre points are not all linearly independent for the space
of polynomials whose restrictions on four edges are polynomials of degree ≤ m, see
(2.1) for details. This means that at least one relation holds, which motivates the
use of higher order monomials of one variable in shape function spaces. In such
a spirit, a class of nonconforming quadrilateral elements is proposed in literature,
which includes, the Han element [8], the nonconforming rotated Q1 element due to
Rannacher and Turek [16], the Douglas-Santos-Sheen-Ye (DSSY) element [6], the
enriched nonconforming rotated Q1 element due to Lin, Tobiska and Zhou [13]. All
of these nonconforming quadrilateral finite element methods are of first order and
are stable for the Stokes problem with pure Dirichlet boundary conditions for the
velocity. However, since the usual Korn inequality does not hold for them, they
can not be applied to the Stokes problem with mixed boundary conditions for the
velocity. Moreover, these nonconforming elements are somehow not extended to
higher order nonconforming elements in literature so far .
In [15], a nonconforming linear element is introduced on quadrilateral meshes,
which is motivated by a key observation that any linear function on a quadrilateral
can be uniquely determined at any three of the four midpoints of edges, which leads
to a set of nodal basis functions whose values at four edges satisfies the aforementioned relation. A similar element (but different on general quadrilateral meshes) is
designed in [9], which is based on an observation that a frame of the linear function
space on the reference element can be mapped and glued to form a basis of the
interpolated space of the conforming bilinear element space by the canonical interpolation operator of the nonconforming rotated Q1 element [16]. This explains why
the element therein is named as “constrained quadrilateral nonconforming rotated
Q1 element” by its authors. Very recently, the ideas of [9, 15] are extended to design
a nonconforming cubic element on quadrilaterals in [14]. We refer interested readers
to [10, 12] for the nonconforming quadratic element on quadrilaterals, which can be
regarded as the quadrilateral counterpart of the triangular Fortin-Soulie element [7].
The purpose paper is to propose nonconforming finite elements of any order on
quadrilaterals in a unifying way, which is somehow missed in literature. Compared
with nonconforming finite elements on triangles [1, 3, 4, 5, 7], there are at least two
more difficulties on quadrilaterals: (1) what shape function spaces should be used for
nonconforming finite elements of any order; (2) how to prove unisolvency of these
degrees of freedom which consist of values of polynomials at aforementioned 4m
Gauss-Legendre points and other degrees of freedom in the interior of elements. It
should be stressed that nonconforming finite elements on quadrilaterals in literature
are defined and analyzed one by one, see [6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
In order to overcome the first difficulty, we propose to use the following two
families of shape function spaces
(1.1)

Rm (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ − x̂ŷ m },

3

(1.2)

ERm (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ − x̂ŷ m, x̂m+1 − ŷ m+1 },

for odd integer m ≥ 1. Here and throughout this paper, Pm (M) denotes the space
of polynomials of degree ≤ m over the domain M; Qm (M) denotes the space of
polynomials of degree ≤ m in each variable. For even m, we propose to use the
same shape function spaces as the serendipity elements of [2, 4], namely,
+
Rm
(K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ, x̂ŷ m }.

(1.3)

These three families of elements generalize the P1 nonconforming element of [9,
15] and the nonconforming cubic element of [14], the nonconforming rotated Q1
element of [16], and the nonconforming quadratic element of [10, 12] to any order,
respectively.
Degrees of freedom are given for these shape function spaces, which are proved
to be well defined based on some observation concerning Legendre polynomials on
four edges. In addition, these finite element spaces are proved to be full spaces.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2, 3 and 4 present three
families of shape function spaces and their corresponding degrees of freedom, which
are proved to be well-defined. Section 5 defines nonconforming finite element spaces
which are proved to be full spaces, and shows approximations of these spaces. Section
6 analyzes consistency errors, which is followed by numerical examples in the final
section.
2. The first family of Shape function spaces
Since Gauss-Legendre points on each edge will be used to define degrees of freedom
and consequently continuity for new elements under consideration, given an integer
k ≥ 0, let gi , i = −k, · · · , −1, 0, 1, · · · , k, denote zeros of Legendre polynomials of
degrees 2k + 1 on the interval [−1, 1]. By skew symmetry, gi = −g−i , i = 1, · · · , k,
and g0 = 0.
Before we present shape function spaces on K̂ := [−1, 1]2 and corresponding
degrees of freedom, we investigate a special relation of values at 8k + 4 GaussLegendre points Gr,i = (1, gi ), Gl,i = (−1, gi ), Gt,i = (gi , 1), Gb,i = (gi , −1), i =
−k, · · · , k on four edges of K̂, of polynomials over K̂ whose restrictions on four
edges are polynomials of degree ≤ 2k + 1.
Lemma 2.1. Let v̂ be a polynomial over K̂ such that its restrictions on four edges
are polynomials of degree ≤ 2k + 1. Then it holds that

Remark 2.2. For k=0, the relation (2.1) is the constraint used in [9, 15]; for k=1,
the relation (2.1) recovers that of [14].
Proof. The main idea is: Since the restrictions of v̂ on four edges are polynomials of
degree ≤ 2k + 1, they can be exactly represented by 2k + 2 Lagrange interpolation
basis functions of degree ≤ 2k + 1 in one dimension, which gives two representations
of values of v̂ at each corner of K̂, then the desired result follows. In order to
accomplish this, first add the point g−k−1 = −1 to these 2k + 1 Gauss-Legendre
points, and define a first set of Lagrange interpolation basis functions:
L0i (x̂)

Then, add the point gk+1 = 1 to these 2k + 1 Gauss-Legendre points, and define
another set of Lagrange interpolation basis functions:

Since span{L0−(k+1) (x̂), · · · , L0k (x̂)} = span{L1−k (x̂), · · · , L1k+1 (x̂)} = P2k+1 ([−1, 1]),
and the restriction of v̂ on each edge of K̂ is a polynomial of degree ≤ 2k + 1, these
restrictions can be expressed as

v̂(±1, ŷ) =

Let αi = L0i (1), i = −(k + 1), · · · , k, and βi = L1i (−1), i = −k, · · · , k + 1. The skew

Given an odd integer m = 2k + 1 ≥ 0, recall shape function spaces:
(2.6)

Rm (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ − x̂ŷ m } for any (x̂, ŷ) ∈ K̂ := [−1, 1]2 .

Note that for k = 0, Rm (K̂) is the shape function space of [9], i.e.,
R1 = span{1, x̂, ŷ}.
For k = 1, Rm (K̂) is the shape function space of [14].
To define degrees of freedom for this space, let G denote the set of Gauss-Legendre
points on four edges of K̂, namely,
(2.7)

G := {(1, gi ), (−1, gi ), (gi , 1), (gi , −1), i = −k, · · · , k}.

To define other degrees of freedom in the interior of K̂, let
(2.8)

I := {(x̂ℓ , ŷℓ ), ℓ = 1, · · · , (2k − 1)(k − 1)}

be a set of interior points of K̂, the standard Lagrange points inside the reference
element K̂, so that any polynomial q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−3 (K̂) can be uniquely defined by
its values at points in I.
Theorem 2.3. If v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm (K̂) vanishes at all points in G ∪ I, cf. (2.7) and
(2.8), then v̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0.

6

J. HU AND SHANGYOU ZHANG

Proof. The function v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm (K̂) can be expressed as
X
(2.9)
ci,j x̂i ŷ j .
v̂(x̂, ŷ) = a0 (x̂2k+1 ŷ − x̂ŷ 2k+1 ) +
i+j≤2k+1

As v̂(1, ŷ) = 0 at 2k +1 Gauss-Legendre points, v̂(1, ŷ) is a multiple of the (2k +1)-st
Legendre polynomial, v̂(1, ŷ) = c0 L2k+1 (ŷ) for some constant c0 . We will show that
the constant c0 is zero. In fact, by the continuity of v̂(x̂, ŷ) at four vertexes of the
square,
(2.10)

v̂(−1, ŷ) = −c0 L2k+1 (ŷ) = −v̂(1, ŷ) for ŷ ∈ [−1, 1],

(2.11)

v̂(x̂, −1) = −c0 L2k+1 (x̂) = −v̂(1, x̂) for x̂ ∈ [−1, 1].

Hence c0 = 0. Thus v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes on the whole boundary ∂ K̂ and can be expressed
as
v̂(x̂, ŷ) = b̂(x̂, ŷ)q̂(x̂, ŷ) with q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−3 (K̂),
where the bubble function b̂(x̂, ŷ) = (1 − x̂2 )(1 − ŷ 2 ). Finally, since v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes
at points in I, q̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0. This completes the proof.

The above theorem implies that any v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm (K̂) can be uniquely determined
by its values at points in G ∪ I. Though the number of points in G ∪ I is (2k +
3)(k + 1) + 2, which is 1 greater than the dimension (2k + 3)(k + 1) + 1 of Rm (K̂), the
relation (2.1) implies that the number of linearly independent functionals defined
for the space Rm (K̂) is equal to the dimension of the shape function space. This
motivates the following degrees of freedom for the shape function space Rm (K̂):
• values at points in G which satisfy the relation (2.1);
• values at points in I.
Remark 2.4. We can take the following shape function spaces
(2.12)

R̃m (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ}, and R̄m (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂ŷ m}.
3. The second family of shape function spaces

As we see in the previous section, functionals defined by values at points in G ∪ I
are not all linearly independent for shape function spaces Rm (K̂) defined in the
previous section, there is a relation (2.1) for all functions in Rm (K̂). To make these
functionals linearly independent for some shape function spaces, we propose to use
higher order monomials of one variable, say x̂2k+2 and ŷ 2k+2 , which motivates to
enrich Rm (K̂) by span{x̂2k+2 − ŷ 2k+2}. This leads to the following shape function
spaces:
(3.1)

ERm (K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂2k+1 ŷ − x̂ŷ 2k+1, x̂2k+2 − ŷ 2k+2 }.

Remark 3.1. For k = 0, the space ERm (K̂) is the shape function space of the
nonconforming rotated Q1 element from [16]:
ER1 (K̂) = span{1, x̂, ŷ, x̂2 − ŷ 2 }.
For the space ERm (K̂), the degrees of freedom are:
• values at points in G, defined in (2.7);
• values at points in I, defined in (2.8).
Theorem 3.2. If v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ ERm (K̂) vanishes at points in G ∪ I, then v̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0.
Proof. By the definition of ERm (K̂), v̂(x̂, ŷ) can be expressed as
(3.2) v̂(x̂, ŷ) = v̂1 (x̂, ŷ) + c1 x̂2k+1 + c2 ŷ 2k+1 + c3 (x̂2k+1 ŷ − x̂ŷ 2k+1) + c4 (x̂2k+2 − ŷ 2k+2 ),
where v̂1 (x̂, ŷ) ∈ Pm (K̂)\span{x̂2k+1 , ŷ 2k+1}, and ci , i = 1, · · · , 4, are four interpolation parameters. This implies that the restrictions of v̂ on four edges of K̂ are

8

J. HU AND SHANGYOU ZHANG

polynomials of degree ≤ 2k +2. Since v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes at m = 2k +1 Gauss-Legendre
points on four edges of K̂, these restrictions on four edges can be written as
(3.3)

v̂(x̂, 1) = L2k+1 (x̂)(a1 x̂ + b1 ),

v̂(x̂, −1) = L2k+1 (x̂)(a2 x̂ + b2 ),

v̂(1, ŷ) = L2k+1 (ŷ)(a3 ŷ + b3 ),

v̂(−1, ŷ) = L2k+1 (ŷ)(a4 ŷ + b4 ),

where ai , bi , i = 1, · · · , 4, are some constants which will be shown to be zero next.
To this end, let c = (4k + 2)!/(22k+1(2k + 1)!) be the coefficient of the monomial
x̂2k+1 of L2k+1 (x̂). A comparison of coefficients from (3.2) and (3.3) for monomials
x̂2k+2 , ŷ 2k+2, x̂2k+1 , and ŷ 2k+1 leads to
(3.4)

a1 = a2 = −a3 = −a4 = c4 /c,

and
(3.5)

c1 + c3 = c b1 ,

c1 − c3 = c b2 ,

c2 − c3 = c b3 ,

c2 + c3 = c b4 .

Note that v̂(x̂, 1) and v̂(1, ŷ) are equal at corner (1, 1), v̂(x̂, 1) and v̂(−1, ŷ) are
equal at corner (−1, 1), v̂(x̂, −1) and v̂(1, ŷ) are equal at corner (1, −1), v̂(x̂, −1)
and v̂(−1, ŷ) are equal at corner (−1, −1). Since L2k+1 (1) = −L2k+1 (−1), these
observations give
(3.6)

a1 + b1 = a3 + b3 ,

a1 − b1 = a4 + b4 ,

a2 + b2 = a3 − b3 ,

a2 − b2 = a4 − b4 .

It follows from (3.4), (3.5) and (3.6) that
(3.7)

a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = b1 = b2 = b3 = b4 = c1 = c2 = c3 = 0.

This implies that c4 = 0 and v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes on the boundary of K̂. Hence,
v̂(x̂, ŷ) = b̂(x̂, ŷ)q̂(x̂, ŷ) with q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−3 (K̂),
where the bubble function b̂(x̂, ŷ) = (1 − x̂2 )(1 − ŷ 2 ). Finally, since v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes
at points in I, q̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0. This completes the proof.

For the space ERm (K̂), we define another set of degrees of freedom as follows
• moments of order ≤ 2k on each edge of K̂;
• values at points in I.
We note that these two sets of degrees of freedom are not equivalent as (2k + 2)
polynomials are involved in ERm (K̂).
Theorem 3.3. For any v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ ERm (K̂), suppose its moments of order ≤ 2k on
each edge of K̂ and values at points in I vanish. Then v̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0.
Proof. By the definition of ERm (K̂), v̂(x̂, ŷ) can be expressed as
v̂(x̂, ŷ) = v̂1 (x̂, ŷ) + c1 x̂2k+1 + c2 ŷ 2k+1 + c3 (x̂2k+1 ŷ − x̂ŷ 2k+1 ) + c4 (x̂2k+2 − ŷ 2k+2 ),

9

where v̂1 (x̂, ŷ) ∈ Pm (K̂)\span{x̂2k+1 , ŷ 2k+1}, and ci , i = 1, · · · , 4, are four interpolation parameters. Consider the restriction on edge ê2 of v̂, denoted by ŵ, which is a
polynomial of degree ≤ 2k + 2. The function ŵ can be decomposed as
ŵ = ŵ1 + ŵ2 ,
where
ŵ1 =

where di , i = 0, 1, · · · , 2(k + 1), are interpolation constants for ŵ. From degrees of

ŵ1 x̂ dx̂ = 0, i = 0, · · · , k, and
ŵ2 x̂2i+1 dx̂ = 0, i = 0, · · · , k − 1.

Since ŵ1 (resp. ŵ2 ) is an even (odd) function on [−1, 1], it holds that

ŵ1 x̂
dx̂ = 0, i = 0, · · · , k, and
ŵ2 x̂2i dx̂ = 0, i = 0, · · · , k.

−1

Note that the degree of polynomial ŵ1 (resp. ŵ2 ) is not more than 2k + 2 (resp.
2k + 1). Therefore both ŵ1 and ŵ2 are Legendre polynomials (up to multiplication
constants), namely,
ŵ1 = a2 L2k+2 (x̂), and ŵ2 = b2 L2k+1 (x̂),
for two constants a2 and b2 . Similar arguments apply to the restrictions on the other
three edges of K̂, which leads to
v̂|ê1 = a1 L2k+2 (ŷ) + b1 L2k+1 (ŷ),
v̂|ê2 = a2 L2k+2 (x̂) + b2 L2k+1 (x̂),
v̂|ê3 = a3 L2k+2 (ŷ) + b3 L2k+1 (ŷ),
v̂|ê4 = a4 L2k+2 (x̂) + b4 L2k+1 (x̂).
Since the coefficient before monomial x̂2k+2 is opposite to that before monomial
ŷ 2k+2 for v̂, this gives

a1 = a3 = −a2 = −a4 .

Let c 6= 0 be the coefficient of monomial x̂2k+1 of L2k+1 (x̂). A comparison of coefficients for monomials x̂2k+1 , and ŷ 2k+1 in v̂|êi , i = 1, · · · , 4, and those in v̂, leads
to
(3.9)

c1 + c3 = cb4 ,

c1 − c3 = cb2 ,

c2 − c3 = cb3 ,

c2 + c3 = cb1 .

Note that v̂(x̂, 1) and v̂(1, ŷ) are equal at corner (1, 1), v̂(x̂, 1) and v̂(−1, ŷ) are
equal at corner (−1, 1), v̂(x̂, −1) and v̂(1, ŷ) are equal at corner (1, −1), v̂(x̂, −1)

10

and v̂(−1, ŷ) are equal at corner (−1, −1). Since e = L2k+1 (1) = −L2k+1 (−1) and
d = L2k+2 (1) = L2k+2 (−1), this leads to
(3.10)

da1 + eb1 = da4 − eb4 ,

da3 + eb3 = da4 + eb4 ,

da3 − eb3 = da2 ecb2 ,

da1 − eb1 = da2 − eb2 .

It follows from (3.8), (3.9) and (3.10) that
a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = b1 = b2 = b3 = b4 = c1 = c2 = c3 = 0.
This implies that c4 = 0 and v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes on the boundary of K̂. Hence,
v̂(x̂, ŷ) = b̂(x̂, ŷ)q̂(x̂, ŷ) with q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−3 (K̂),
where the bubble function b̂(x̂, ŷ) = (1 − x̂2 )(1 − ŷ 2 ). Finally, since v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes
at points of I, q̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0. This completes the proof.

4. The third family of shape function spaces
For nonconforming elements of even order, there is always a discrete bubble function which vanishes at 4m Gauss-Legendre points. Thus, in additional to one extra
term for Rm of odd m, we need another extra term enriching Pm polynomials so
that the finite element function has exactly 4m degrees of freedom on the element
boundary. For m = 2k, we define the third family of nonconforming elements by
+
Rm
(K̂) := Pm (K̂) + span{x̂m ŷ, x̂ŷ m }.

(4.1)

For the continuity requirement, we need use the m = 2k Gauss-Legendre points,
g−k , . . . , g−1 , g1 , . . . , gk .
+
Lemma 4.1. Let v̂ ∈ Rm
be a polynomial over K̂ such that its restrictions on four
edges are polynomials of degree ≤ 2k. Then it holds that

Q
gi (1 − gi2 ) k|i|6=j=1(gi2 − gj2 )
06=i=−k

Proof. We add the point g−k−1 = −1 to the 2k Gauss-Legendre points, and define a
first set of Lagrange interpolation basis functions:
L0i (x̂) =

k
Y

0,i6=j=−(k+1)

x̂ − gj
,
gi − gj

i = −(k + 1), −k, · · · , −1, 1, · · · , k.

At the other end, adding a point gk+1 = 1, we define another set of Lagrange
interpolation basis functions:
L1i (x̂)

=

k+1
Y

x̂ − gj
,
gi − gj
0,i6=j=−k

i = −k, · · · , −1, 1, · · · , k + 1.

11

Since
P2k ([−1, 1]) = span{L0i (x̂), i = −k − 1, · · · , −1, 1, · · · , k}
= span{L1i (x̂), i = −k, · · · , −1, 1, · · · , k + 1},
and the restriction of v̂ on each edge of K̂ is a polynomial of degree ≤ 2k, we have
the four equations in (2.4). Again, let

α−k−1 = βk+1 ,

and αi = −βi if i = −k, · · · , −1, 1, . . . , k.

This is simplified to (4.2).



To define degrees of freedom for this space, let the set of even Gauss-Legendre
points on four edges of K̂ be
G+ := {(1, gi ), (−1, gi ), (gi , 1), (gi , −1), 0 6= i = −k, · · · , k}.
To define other degrees of freedom in the interior of K̂, let
I + := {(x̂ℓ , ŷℓ ), ℓ = 1, · · · , (2k − 3)(k − 1)}

12

J. HU AND SHANGYOU ZHANG

be a set of interior points of K̂, the standard Lagrange points inside the reference
element K̂, so that any polynomial q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−4 (K̂) can be uniquely defined by
its values at points in I + .
+
Theorem 4.2. If v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm
(K̂) vanishes at all points in G+ ∪ I + ∪ {(1, 1)}, then
v̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0.
+
Proof. The function v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm
(K̂) is a P2k polynomial when restricted to ŷ = 1.
On the edge ŷ = 1, v̂ vanishes at 2k Gauss-Legendre points plus a corner point
{(1, 1)}. So v̂ ≡ 0 on ŷ = 1. Repeating the argument, as v̂ is continuous at the four
corners, we find v̂ ≡ 0 on the whole boundary.

v̂(x̂, ŷ) = b̂(x̂, ŷ)q̂(x̂, ŷ) with q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−4 (K̂),
where b̂(x̂, ŷ) = (1 − x̂2 )(1 − ŷ 2 ). Here with a careful division, we find the coefficients
for xm y and y m x in v̂ are zero. So q̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ P2k−4 (K̂). Finally, since v̂(x̂, ŷ) vanishes
at points of I, q̂(x̂, ŷ) ≡ 0. This completes the proof.

+
The above theorem implies that any v̂(x̂, ŷ) ∈ Rm
(K̂) can be uniquely determined
+
+
by its values at points in G ∪ I ∪ {(1, 1)}. But the number of points is one more
+
than the dimension of Rm
(K̂). The relation (4.2) implies that the number of linearly
+
independent functionals defined for the space Rm
(K̂) is equal to the dimension of
the space. This motivates the following degrees of freedom for the shape function
+
(K̂):
space Rm

• values at points in G+ which satisfy the relation (4.2);
• value at point (1, 1);
• values at points in I + .
Note that the value at point (1, 1) is to determine the coefficient of the discrete
bubble function in v̂:

b̂0 (x̂, ŷ) =

5. Nonconforming finite element spaces
This section defines nonconforming quadrilateral element spaces.
5.1. Quadrilateral Mesh. Let Th := {Ki , i = 1, · · · , Ne} be a shape regular
quadrilateral partition of Ω with diam(Ki ) ≤ h. We assume that the partition
Th satisfies the bisection condition of [17]: The distance dK between the midpoints
of two diagonals of each element K is of order O(h2 ).
For a given element K ∈ Th , its four nodes are denoted by Ai (xi , yi ), i = 1, · · · , 4
in the counterclockwise order. Let K̂ := [−1, 1]2 denote the reference element with

5.2. Nonconforming finite element spaces and dimensions. For an odd integer m = 2k + 1 > 0, define nonconforming finite element spaces by
(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

Rh := {v ∈ L2 (Ω), v|K ◦ FK−1 ∈ Rm (K̂) for any K ∈ Th , v is continuous
at m Gauss-Legendre points of each interior edge of Th }.

at m Gauss-Legendre points of each interior edge of Th }.

where [v] denotes the jump of v across edge e. We note again that ERhM is different
from ERhP due to the higher order polynomial term (x2k+2 − y 2k+2). For an even
integer m = 2k, the nonconforming finite element space is defined by
(5.4)

+
Rh+ := {v ∈ L2 (Ω), v|K ◦ FK−1 ∈ Rm
(K̂) for any K ∈ Th , v is continuous

at m Gauss-Legendre points of each interior edge of Th }.

The corresponding homogeneous spaces are defined, respectively,

Th , define
(5.9)

GK := G ◦ FK , and IK := I ◦ FK .

Then, define the canonical interpolation operator ΠPER : H 2 (Ω) → ERhP by
(5.10)

(ΠPER v|K )(p) = v|K (p) for any p ∈ GK ∪ IK and K ∈ Th

for any v ∈ H 2 (Ω).

To define an interpolation operator for Rh , let ΠQ be the canonical interpolation
operator of the conforming Qm element space Qm,h := {v ∈ H 1 (Ω), v|K ◦ FK−1 ∈
Qm (K̂), K ∈ Th }. Then, define an interpolation operator ΠR : H 2 (Ω) → Rh by
(5.12)

(ΠR v|K )(p) = ΠQ v|K (p) for any p ∈ GK ∪ IK and K ∈ Th

for any v ∈ H 2 (Ω). Since the values at points in GK of ΠQ v satisfy the relation
(2.1), this operator is well-defined.
For the even order nonconforming finite elements, we define
(5.13) (ΠR+ v|K )(p) = ΠQ v|K (p)

+
for any p ∈ G+
K ∪ IK ∪ {FK (1, 1)} and K ∈ Th

for any v ∈ H 2 (Ω). Since the values of Qm polynomial ΠQ v at points in G+
K satisfy
+
2
the constraint (4.2), the operator ΠR+ : H (Ω) → Rh is well-defined.

15

An immediate consequence of these interpolation operators is the following approximation property
(5.14)

inf k∇h (u − vh )k0 ≤ Chm kukm+1 ,

vh ∈Vh

provided that u ∈ H m+1 (Ω) and the mesh satisfies the bisection condition where
Vh = Rh , ERhP , ERhM , Rh+ .
5.4. The full space of nonconforming finite elements. For the finite element
P
M
spaces ERh,0
and ERh,0
, local nodal basis functions are uniquely determined, which
are glued together to form the global nodal basis functions. Thus, the interpolation
operators ΠPER and ΠM
ER , cf. (5.10) and (5.11), are on-to mappings, by which the
dimension of the finite element spaces can be counted.
Let NV , NS , and NE denote the numbers of vertexes, edges and elements of the
partition Th , respectively. Let NVi , NVb , NSi and NSb denote the numbers of interior
vertexes, interior edges, boundary vertexes and boundary edges, respectively. The
dimensions are
(5.15)

P
M
dim ERh,0
= dim ERh,0
= NE (2k − 1)(k − 1) + NSi (2k + 1).

+
However, for nonconforming spaces Rh,0 and Rh,0
, the local nodal basis is not
unique. The canonical basis functions are not linearly independent but subject to the
constraints (2.1) and (4.2). When gluing these functions together to form the global
space, it is not clear if they can form a basis for the full space. In other words, the
local constraints (2.1) (on each element) might be linearly dependent globally, that
is, some constraints may be automatically satisfied when the neighboring elements
are subject to the constraints. If so, the interpolation operators ΠR and ΠR+ in (5.12)
and (5.13) are not on-to mappings. Then, the computational finite element spaces
are not the full spaces defined mathematically in (5.1) and (5.4), but subspaces. This
problem is not well-addressed in previous research. We give a rigorous analysis.

Theorem 5.1. The interpolation operators are on-to mappings that
(5.16)

ΠR (Qm,h ∩ H01 (Ω)) = Rh,0 ,

(5.17)

+
.
ΠR+ (Qm,h ∩ H01 (Ω)) = Rh,0

The dimensions of these spaces are
(5.18)

dim Rh,0 = NE ((2k − 1)(k − 1)) + NVi + NSi (2k),

(5.19)

+
= NE ((2k − 3)(k − 1) + 1) + NVi + NSi (2k − 1).
dim Rh,0

+
Proof. We analyze the space Rh,0 only as that for Rh,0
is the same. Rh,0 is defined
as the full space. But the range of the interpolation operator is a subspace

ΠR (Qm,h ∩ H01 (Ω)) ⊂ Rh,0 .

16

J. HU AND SHANGYOU ZHANG

To show that the two spaces are equal, we show that the dimension of the range of
ΠR is no less than that of the full space Rh,0 . The former is easily counted by the
definition of the operator ΠR in (5.12),
(5.20)

dim Range(ΠR ) = NE ((2k − 1)(k − 1)) + NVi + NSi (2k).

We define a completely discontinuous space
Rhd = {v ∈ L2 (Ω) | v|K ◦ FK−1 ∈ Rm (K̂) ∀K ∈ Th }.
Then
(5.21)

dim Rhd = NE · (dim P2k+1 + 1) = NE ((2k + 3)(k + 1) + 1).

Now, we introduce linear functionals on the space Rhd :
(5.22)
(5.23)

fi : Rhd → R1 ,
(
v(gi )
fi (v) =
v(gi+ ) − v(gi− )

for any gi ∈ GK ∩ ∂Ω,
for rest gi ∈ GK ∩ Ωi ,

for any K ∈ Th , where we randomly choose a plus side for each edge, and v(gi+ ) and
v(gi+ ) are values of v on the two sides of an edge where gi is a Gauss-Legendre point,
defined in (2.7). The nonconforming finite element space Rh is the kernel space of
the space of above linear functionals.
Assume the domain is simply connected. Let gi be any one boundary GaussLegendre point. Let the linear functional evaluating at this point be f0 . We show
next that value of f0 (v) = v(gi ) is completely determined by the rest nodal values
for all v ∈ Rh . For example, if the domain consists of one element K, then v(gi ) =
P
γi−1 j6=i −γj v(gj ), cf. (2.1). We define a set for the rest linear functionals in (5.23)
(5.24)

F = {fi | i = 1, 2, · · · , NS (2k + 1) − 1}.

Assume
dim
XF

(5.25)

ci fi = 0.

i=1

That is
dim
XF

ci fi (vh ) = 0 ∀vh ∈ Rhd .

i=1

For convenience, we let c0 = 0. Let vh ∈ Rhd and vh = 0 on all elements except the
element where f0 is defined. We have then
0=

dim
XF
i=0

By the constraint (2.1),

ci fi (vh ) =

4m−1
X

ci (±vh (gi )).

i=0

ci = cγi or − cγi

17

for some uniform constant c. But above {ci } contains c0 which is 0. Thus all ci
related to the element K are 0. In this fashion, we know that all ci in (5.25) are 0
and the set F is linearly independent. Then the dimension of its kernel is dim F .
By (5.21) and (5.24), (5.18) holds,
dim Rh,0 = dim Rhd − dim F
= NE ((2k + 3)(k + 1) + 1) − (NS (2k + 1) − 1)
= NE ((2k − 1)(k − 1)) + NSi (2k) + NVi ,
where we used the relations 4NE = 2NSi + NSb , 2NE = 2NVi + NVb − 2 and NVb = NSb .
(5.16) follows (5.20) and (5.18).

6. The analysis of consistency errors
To analyze consistency errors, we need some additional interpolation operators.
On the interval [−1, 1], define two L2 projection operators Pm−i : L2 ([−1, 1]) →
Pm−i ([−1, 1]), for i = 1, 2, respectively,
Z 1
Z 1
(6.1)
Pm−i w qds =

for any w ∈ L2 ([−1, 1]). Define the interpolation Πm−1 : C 0 ([−1, 1]) → Pm−1 ([−1, 1])
by
(Πm−1 v)(gi ) = v(gi ), i = −k, · · · , k, for any v ∈ C 0 ([−1, 1]),

(6.2)

where gi are Gauss-Legendre points on the interval [−1, 1]. We recall that ê1 and ê3
be two edge of K̂ that parallel to the ŷ axis, see Figure 1.
P
Since the analysis of consistency errors for both Rh,0 and ERh,0
is similar, only

The first term I1 can be bounded by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the trace theorem and the usual Bramble-Hilbert lemma,
|I1 | ≤ C|û|H m (K̂) |v̂|H m (K̂) .
To analyze the second term I2 , introduce the following decomposition for v̂
v̂ = v̂1 + v̂2 ,
where v̂1 ∈ Pm (K̂) + span{x̂2k+1 ŷ − x̂ŷ 2k+1 }, and v̂2 = c0 (x̂2k+2 − ŷ 2k+2) with c0 , an
interpolation constant. Since v̂1 |êi − Πm−1 v̂1 |êi , i = 1, 3, are polynomials of degree
at most 2k + 1, and vanish at 2k + 1 Gauss-Legendre points of êi ,
v̂1 |êi − Πm−1 v̂1 |êi = ci L2k+1 (ŷ),
with two constants ci , i = 1, 3. Since degrees of polynomials Pm−1 û|êi , i = 1, 3, are
not more than 2k, this gives

7. Numerical test
We compute the Pk nonconforming finite element solutions on uniform rectangular
grids for the following Poisson equation:
−∆u = f
u=0

in Ω = (0, 1)2,
on ∂Ω.

In computation, the exact solution is,
u(x, y) = 24 (x − x6 )(y − y 2 ).

The first level grid is the unit square. Each subsequent grid is a refinement of the
last one by dividing each square into 4, denoted by {Th }. We use the following 6
nonconforming finite elements:

We list the computation results in Tables 1–6. In all cases except the case of polynomial degree 3, we stop the computation when the machine accuracy is reached,
i.e., the relative error of computed solutions is about 10−15 . We can see, for all the
finite element spaces, the computational solutions converge at the optimal order of
rate. This is proved in paper.
