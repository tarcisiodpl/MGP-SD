There is much interest in providing proba-·
bilistic semantics for defaults but most ap­
proaches seem to suffer from one of two prob­
lems: either they require numbers, a problem
defaults were intended to avoid, or they gen­
erate peculiar side effects.
Rather than provide semantics to defaults,
we address the original problem that defaults
were intended to solve: that of reasoning un­
der uncertainty where numeric probability
distributions are not available. We describe
a non-numeric formalism called an inference
graph based on standard probability theory,
conditional independence and sentences of
confirmation, where a confirms b = coni( a, b)
= p(a!b) > p(a).
The formalism seems to handle the exam­
ples from the nonmonotonic literature. Most
importantly, the sentences of our system can
be verified by performing an appropriate ex­
periment in the semantic domain.

should not be thought of as having any mean­
ing in. the sense of "most" or "typical"; they
are statements the user is prepared to accept
as part of an explanation as to why some­
thing may be true.
What, then, does a default mean? Within
the default logic camp, we know of no work
which provides a semantics for defaults, in
the sense that an experiment is described
that can be performed in the semantic do­
main to verify the truth of a default. It is
therefore compelling to view defaults as qual­
itative probabilistic statements where nu­
meric distributions are unavailable. We sur­
vey some of these views but note most re­
quire numbers, something default reasoning
intended to avoid, or have side effects.
Rather than "add semantics" to defaults,
we construct a sound non-numeric proba­
bilistic formalism called an inference graph.
We explore its mathematical properties, then
apply it to the standard examples. We con­
clude with a brief description of the imple­
mentation.

Introduction

Though default r�asoning involves reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, some
argue it is not probabilistic reasoning. Reiter and Crisculo [21] distinguish the two by
suggesting different interpretations for the
word "most" . Probabilistic reasoning gives
"most" a statistical connotation, whereas default logic gives it a prototypical sense. On
the other hand, Poole (18] claims defaults

What's in a default?

Poole et al [20] attempt to put both default
reasoning and diagnosis under a single urn­
brella by constructing a system containing a
set of facts F known to be true, a set � of
defaults, and g, a set of (possible) observa­
tions which are goals to be proved. Here we
assume F, �and g are propositional.

is consistent.

p(flb) = p(fleb)P(elb) + p(ll-.eb)p(-.elb)

then D is an ezplanation of g. This system is
based on a theorem prover and can be used
in two ways. If g consists of observations
known to be true, we interpret g as querying
t»hy g?, and Dis a diagnosis of g. If g is not
known to be true, then g is interpreted as
querying t»hether g?, and g is a prediction of
FUD. The problem default logic runs into is
that there _is typically another D' such that
FuD' predicts -.g; this is known as the mul­
tiple eztension prob lem and is discussed be­
low. (This is a very abbreviated presentation
of default reasoning; for details on implemen­
tation and application see [15,14).)
AJJ pointed out in the introduction, de­
faults appear to have no semantics, and
many researchers study the relationship be­
tween default reasoning and uncertainty.
Rich [22) advocates adding certainty factors
to possible hypotheses to fine-tune a default
reasoning syst�m and concludes "default rea­
soning is likelihood reasoning and treating it
that way simplifies it" . While some argue
with her treatment, her conclusions seem to
be widely held. Ginsberg [4] pursues this ap­
proach.
At the 1987 Workshop on Uncertainty in
AI, Groaof suggested defaults are interval­
valued probabilities on the entire unit inter­
val. Default inference thus becomes closely
related to Kyburg's theory of interval-valued
probabilities [8,7).
In [9]; McCarthy states non-monotonic
sentences can represent statements of in­
finitesimal probability, but does not go into
detail. Pearl explores this in [12]. This inter­
pretation has some problems. Let e = emu,
b -:- bird, I = fly. If

it follows p( elb) � 0. But since a prior is
always bounded by its conditionals on any
evidence and the negation of that evidence,
we can show p(e) � 0.
Default logic also has this "property":
from no knowledge at all, we can prove -.emu
by cases from fly and -.fly using the contra­
positive forms C?f the defaults. This intro­
duces the following variant of the "lottery
paradox" (8].
Suppose kangaroos (k) are
exceptional because they have a marsupial
birth and platypusses (p) are exceptional be­
cause they lay eggs but dingos (d) have no
such exceptional traits. If
Example 2.1

ozzie-animal => e Vk V p V d,
then p( dl ozzie-animal) is close to one since
the disjunction of the other three is close to
zero. Default reasoning and circumscription
(16] suffer the same problem. Poole [17,3]
solves this by explicitly pruning the proof
tree with a set of sentences called constraints.
However, to do this, you need to know the
right answers in advance.

Besides making subclasses vanish, Pearl's
£-semantics suffers another problem: in gen­
eral, it is impossible to go out into a real
problem domain and find a set of conditional
probabilities infinitely close to one.
Bacchus[1] addresses this issue of practi­
cality and argues for thresholding, that is,
that a possible hypothesis stands for a prob­
ability greater than some threshold k > 1/2.
His system allows only a single defeasible in­
ference, since p(bla) > k and p(clb) > k do
not in general constrain the value of p (cia)
p(flb) � 1, p(fle) � O,p(ble) � 1
to be greater thank.
There seems to be no end to different prob­
(i.e., there are some non-bird emus) then

semantics that might be added to
from
defaults or inference rules that might be in­
vented to come up with the right answers for

sary to ask again what were the original goals
of formalisms such as default reasoning, in­
heritance hierarchies and semantic nets. We
should reconsider the original objections to
standard probability, and ask whether we
solve the problem in a principled way, with­
out tlie invention of new formalisms.

This provides an

interesting venue to explore: rather than use
knowledge of the form "birds are more likely
to fly than not" , we consider knowledge of
the form "an individual is more likely to fly
once we learn that it is a bird" .

Consider Nutter's example ( 10], where in

springtime it is not true that most birds fly,
since most birds are flightless nestlings. Yet,
the information that an individual is a bird
inclines us to shift belief in favour of flying.
This

tence. If we say "Irish Canadians have red

most all Irish Canadians have red hair, even
though the stereotype is widely held.

explore the kinds of inferences about confir­

By definition, p(ajb) > p(a). Negat­

p(bj-.a) < p(b) by Lemma 4.2 and negating
again yields p(-.bl..:.,a) > p(-.b). Another ap­
plication of Lemma 4.2 yields the desired re­
sult. 0
Thus, not only does bird increase belief in
fly, -.bird increases belief in -.fly. An inter­
esting intermediate result is that the "contra­
positive" form of a link yields a valid infer­
ence, so long as it is made from a single link.
This means use of the contrapositive form of
a link is valid, bu.t the context of such an
inference must be carefully restricted. Infer­

ficity" . Poole [19] calls it preferring the most

the most specific extension.
W hile the default logic view seems to be
to prefer the conclusion based on the most
specific knowledge, we remark that there is
not universal agreement on this in the prob­
abilist community when statistics are not
good. Kyburg [7,8] suggests we make an
inference based on the narrowest reference
class for which we have adequate statistics.

However, if c is conditionally independent of
