1. Introduction

This paper presents a method of
optimization, based on both Bayesian Analysis
technical and Gallois Lattice, of a Fuzzy
Semantic Networks. The technical System we
use learn by interpreting an unknown word using
the links created between this new word and
known words. The main link is provided by the
context of the query. When novice’s query is
confused with an unknown verb (goal) applied
to a known noun denoting either an object in the
ideal user’s Network or an object in the user’s
Network, the system infer that this new verb
corresponds to one of the known goal. With the
learning of new words in natural language as the
interpretation, which was produced in agreement
with the user, the system improves its
representation scheme at each experiment with a
new user and, in addition, takes advantage of
previous discussions with users. The semantic
Net of user objects thus obtained by these kinds
of learning is not always optimal because some
relationships between couple of user objects can
be generalized and others suppressed according
to values of forces that characterize them.
Indeed, to simplify the obtained Net, we propose
to proceed to an inductive Bayesian analysis, on
the Net obtained from Gallois lattice. The
objective of this analysis can be seen as an
operation of filtering of the obtained descriptive
graph.

In order to respond to a query, an executive
assistant might know very precisely the goal that
the user has in mind, which means an object in a
given state (the properties of the object being
transformed). Moreover, even when goals are
fairly well defined, it is often necessary to think
about superordinate goals.

The Gallois Lattice and the fuzzy sets methods
have been used to develop the "on-line
instructions" mechanisms of an Intelligent
Assistance System. It can be seen as a supervisor
of task execution that has the "ideal user's
knowledge" of (i) prerequisites of procedures,
(ii) subGoals structure, and (iii) the semantic
network of the elements of the device where
applied procedures are used as properties, as
well as (iv) the knowledge of perceptible and
imperceptible effects of user's actions. With an
interactive dialogue with a user, the Assistance
System tries to match items provided by users in
natural language with the knowledge included in
the ideal user's semantic network.
The example of the technical system we
consider here is Word Processor software, with
Objects such as "chain-of-characters", and
procedures such as "cut" or "copy". For a novice
user of the software, the list of standard
denominations is not obvious and he often
would like to ask an expert operator about how
to execute an action such as "how to rub letters"
[Omri & Tijus, 99a], [Omri & Chenaina, 99b].

primary knowledge and the new labels of
Objects or procedures expressed by the user.

Construction of the Ideal Expert
Knowledge starts if given a set of Tasks that are
executed using elements of one technical device
through procedures. The first step is the task
decomposition as a hierarchy of Goal
decomposition into subGoals from the level of
the Goal of the task to primitive actions. The
second step consists in (i) drawing up a list of
possible Goals and the procedures to reach these
Goals (ii) constructing the Ideal Expert Net as a
classical semantic network. But, instead of using
structural properties of system's interface
Objects, Goals reachable with those Objects are
used as properties.

3. How Technical System improves its
representation schema

However given the polysemic aspects of natural
language (verbs and nouns which express goals
and device objects), with the necessity of a manmachine interface that involve queries of users,
the problem that is under investigation is how to
match the content of a query (the label of an
Object and the label of a Goal applied to this
Object, as expressed by a novice user) to their
corresponding items (class of Objects and Goals
as properties) in the Ideal Expert Net. By
answering queries of the users while they try to
perform a given goal, the Expert Assistant
delivers not only planning information, but also
a goal structure and the knowledge of what
justifies the procedure by providing the
knowledge that is included in the Ideal Expert
Net.
If the Assistance System does not understand the
meaning of an instruction, it discusses with the
user until it is able to interpret the query in its
own language. With the learning of new words
in natural language as the interpretation
produced in agreement with the user, the system
improves its representation scheme at each
experiment with a new user and, in addition,
takes advantage of previous discussions with
users: (i) the standard Objects and recognized by
the software are described in a semantic network
where goals stand for properties of Objects, (ii)
as the queries of an user are expressed in natural
language and as they correspond more or less to
these standard denominations, the system
establishes fuzzy connections between its

The system’s capacity to interpret an
unknown word using the links created between
this new word and known words defines the
notion of learning in our case. The main link is
provided by the context of the query. When
novice’s query is confused with an unknown
verb (goal) applied to a known noun denoting
either an object in the ideal user’s Network or an
object in the user’s Network, the system infer
that this new verb corresponds to one of the
known goal. With the learning of new words in
natural language as the interpretation, which was
produced in agreement with the user, the system
improves its representation scheme at each
experiment with a new user and, in addition,
takes advantage of previous discussions with
users. Knowledge database presents three levels
or kinds of learning: we distinguish between
states goals dynamics, states objects dynamics
and states relationships dynamics.

4. Optimization of the Fuzzy Semantic
Nets by Bayesian Analysis
The approach that we present in this paper
is established from Procope‘s formalism
(Poitrenaud, Richard and Tijus, 1990), based on
the Gallois lattice method (Génoche & Van
Mechelen, 1993) and the Bayesian formalism.
The underlying idea is to end to a hierarchical
structure of object users allowing to have a
process of categorization by discrimination and
generalization. To end to a hierarchical structure
of user objects in the form of a symbolic data
table, the method of the Gallois lattice is the
means that we have adopted to construct the
semantic user object system. This construction
consists; from a symbolic table of linguistic
data, to construct, in a first time the binary table
(crossed system’s objets with user objects are
obtained by 0 and 1). In a second time the
different implications between each couple of
user objects. To illustrate this method, we
propose to construct the semantic user objects
Net corresponding to the following symbolic
table (table 2).

This table allows us to construct the user objects
Net with all possible implications between each
couple of objects. The semantic Net of users
objects obtained is not always optimal because
some relationships between couple of user

objects can be generalized and others suppressed
according to values of forces that characterize
them. Indeed, to simplify the obtained Net, we
propose to proceed to an inductive Bayesian
analysis, on Net obtained from Gallois lattice.

The principal objective of this analysis is to put
to day the possible oriented dependence existing
between different user objects: the knowledge of
some will determine - it such or such others. To
reply to this objective, we have considered the
following user objects: The number, The Sign,
The letters, The numbers, The Characters and
Substantive.
These user objects represent
synonymies by novice users to designate the
following system’s objects: Char, Word and
Key. To determine the different binary
relationships between each couple, the analysis
consists in study the implicative structure to
each couple, then to present the totality of the
implicative structures corresponding to the form
of implicative graph (figure 1).

From observations realized on each couple
of user objects, we have built the following table
that presents sorting crossed in effective for each
pair of user objects. Each places in table 3
represents 768 users of the software that we
have put in place. For instance, in the first
places, corresponding to the couple of objects
'the Sign' and 'the number', 100 users have used
the word 'the Sign' to each time that they have
used the word 'the number' to designate a
system's object. 30 other users have used the
word 'the number' without used the word 'the
Sign'. 85 have used the word 'the Sign' without
using the word 'the number' and 538 remainder
of the effective total have not used neither the
word 'the Sign' nor the word 'the number' to
designate system's object.
For each of these crossed sorting, we calculate
the indication H of Loevinger associated to the
four possible error squares. Positive indices are
represented in fat (table 4). If we consider the
two values-mark htend=0.40 and hquasi=0.60, we
have to respect next conclusions:
H < Htend absence of q - implication
htend ≤ H ≤ Htend tendency to the q - implication
H ≥ Htend q – implication

The suitable figure 2 emerges two possible
cases. The first case, constituted following user
objects : Substantive, The number, The Sign, The
letters, and The numbers, positive connection
following q-implication from The number to The
Sign, The Sign to The letters with tendency to
the equivalence, q-implication with equivalence
between The Sign and The numbers, tendency to
the q - implication from The Sign to The
numbers and between The number and
Substantive with tendency to the equivalence.
The second case, constituted by the number user
objects, Substantive, The Characters and The

Sign presents relationships of q-exclusion and
tendency to the q-exclusion.

4.2 Processing by the Inductive Bayesian
Analysis
This stage consists in determine with the
help of the AIB, observed oriented relationships
descriptively that can be certified inductively,
among all relationships in order that the
indication H ≥ 0.20. The objective of this
analysis can be seen as an operation of filtering
of the obtained descriptive graph (figure 2). In

order that, we are going to calculate, to each
places in the table 4 above (H < 0.20), the
inferior credibility limit, for a guarantee - mark
δ=90, for the corresponding indication dress η.
To realize these calculations, we have used a
recent version of the software AIB-2 developed
in the cognitive Psychology Laboratory of the
University Paris VIII. Results of these
calculations are presented in the following table
5. Negative values are not taken in account and
therefore it does not appear in table 5.

The number

The results of this filtering allow determining
relationships that can be generalized, among the
totality of observed relationships descriptively.
According to the graph of the figure 3, one can
certify on the one hand, a q-implication with
tendency to the equivalence between The Sign
and the letters user objects and a q-implication
from The Sign to The number. On the other
hand, a tendency to the q-implication from
Substantive to The number. For the implication
from the letters to The Characters and from this
last to the numbers, one notices that there is an
absence of q-implication with tendency to the
exclusion.

Conclusion

Although the approach presented in this
paper, that consists of an optimization of a fuzzy
semantic Networks after learning, does not
represent a methodology to diagnosis the goal
query’s novice users, allows identifying the
unknown novice user request of the share of the

device used. This can serve as basis for our
research so as to elaborate a general
methodology to diagnosis the purpose goal of
the subject, applicable to a large diversity of
devices. The objective being to find the totality
of compatible purposes with actions of the users,
the trip of such graphs facilitates grandly the
research. The development of this method would
have to allow a best approximation of the
category of the purpose aimed by the user, and
best approaches the diagnosis.
