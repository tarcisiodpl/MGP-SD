cussed a Bayesian method of causal discovery from a
mixture of observational and experimental data.

We propose a new method of discovering
causal structures, based on the detection
of local, spontaneous changes in the un­
derlying data-generating model. We ana­
lyze the classes of structures that are equiv­
alent relative to a stream of distributions
produced by local changes, and devise algo­
rithms that output graphical representations
of these equivalence classes. We present ex­
perimental results, using simulated data, and
examine the errors associated with detection
of changes and recovery of structures.

We propose a new method of discovering causal rela­
tions in data, based on the detection and interpreta­
tion of local spontaneous changes in the environment.
While previous methods assume that data are gener­
ated by a static statistical distribution, our proposal
aims at exploiting dynamic changes in that distribu­
tion. Such changes are always present in any realistic
domain that is embedded in a larger background of
dynamically changing conditions. For example, nat­
ural disasters, armed conflicts, epidemics, labor dis­
putes, and even mundane decisions by other agents,
are unexpected eventualities that are not naturally
captured in distribution functions. The occurrence of
such eventualities tend to alter the distribution un­
der study and yield changes that are markedly dif­
ferent from ordinary statistical fluctuations. Whereas
static analysis views these changes as nuisance, and
attempts to adjust and compensate for them, we will
view them as a valuable source of information about
the data-generating process. A controlled experimen­
tal study may be thought of as a special case of these
environmental changes, where the external influence
involves fixing a designated variable to some predeter­
mined value. In general, however, the external influ­
ence may be milder, merely changing the conditional
probability of a variable, given its causes. Moreover,
in marked contrast to controlled experiments, we may
not know in advance the nature of the change, its lo­
cation, or even whether it took place; these may need
to be inferred from the data itself.

Introduction

In recent years, several graph-based algorithms
have been developed for the purpose of inferring
causal structures from empirical data. Some are
based on detecting patterns of conditional inde­
pendence
relationships
[Pearl and Verma, 1991,
Spirtes et al., 1993], and some are based on
Bayesian approaches [Cooper and Herskovits, 1992,
Heckerman et al., 1 995]
These discovery methods
assume static environment, that is, a time-invariant
distribution and a time-invariant data-generating
model, and attempt to infer structures that encode
dynamic aspects of the environment, for example, how
probabilities would change as a result of interventions.
This transition, from static to dynamic information,
constitutes a major inferential leap, and is severely
limited by the inherent indistinguishability (or
equivalence) relation that governs Bayesian networks
[Verma and Pearl, 1990].
.

One way of overcoming this basic limitation is to
augment the data with partial causal knowledge, if
such is available. [Spirtes et al., 1993], for exam­
ple, discussed the use of experimental data to iden­
tify causal relationships. [Cooper and Yoo, 1999] dis-

The basic idea has its roots in the economic literature.
The economist Kevin Hoover (1990) attempted to in­
fer the direction of causal influences among economic
variables (e.g., employment and money supply) by ob­
serving the changes that sudden modifications in the
economy (e.g., tax reform, labor dispute) induced in
the statistics of these variables. Hoover assumed that
the conditional probability of an effect given its causes

TIAN & PEARL

UAI2001

remains invariant to changes in the mechanism that
generates the cause, while the conditional probability
of a cause given the effect would not remain invariant
under such ch anges. This asymmetry may be useful in
disting ui shi ng cause and effect.
Today we understand more precisely the conditions
under which such asymmetries would prevail and how

to interpret such asy mmet ries in the context of large,
multi-variate systems. Whenever we obtain reliable in­

formation (e.g., from historical or institutional knowl­
edge) that an abrupt local change has taken place
in a specific mechanism that constrains a given fam­
ily of variables, we can use the observed changes in

the marginal and conditional probabilities surround­
ing those variables to determine the direction of causal
influences in the domain. The statistical features that
remain invariant under such changes, as well as the
causal assumptions underlying this invariance, are en­
coded in the causal diagram at hand, and can be
used therefore for testing the validity of a given struc­
ture. Lik ewise, conflicts between observed and pre­
dicted changes can be used for automatic restruct uring
of the topology of the structure at hand.

A TS is simply a series of TP's. Accordingly, we say
that a causal diagram is compatible with a transition
sequence Prs = (P0, P1, .. . , pk), F = (Vi., . . . , Vi�o)
if it is compatible with each TP (Pi-l, Pi) in the se­
quence. Likewise, two causal diagrams G1 and G2 are
called transition sequence equivalent with respect to a
TS (Prs, F), or F-transition equivalent, if every TS
(Prs,F) compatible with G1 is also compatible with
G2. Two causal diagrams are statistically indistin­
guishable given a TS (Prs, F) if and only if they are
F-transition equivalent.

Theorem 3 says that a TS determines the directions of
the edges between the focal variables and their neigh­
bors (among the set of independence-equivalent dia­
grams). Figure 1 shows an example ofTS equivalence.
Given a TS, the most we can expect to recover is a set
of causal diagrams that are TS-equivalent, as defined
by Theorem 3. We may find this equivalence class
by detecting independence relations and distribution
changes.

the same bucket, all variables in a bucket stand in

bucket. Focal variables need special treatment since
they carry more information, and we will put each fo­

Learning Causation by Detecting
Changes

In this section, we identify the causal information that
can be learned by detecting various changes in the
probability distributions, in particular, changes in the
marginal probability of each variable. The following
theorem is obvious.
Theorem 4 A mechanism change at a variable

X

to
a causal model M = <G, So> may alter the marginal
probabilities of the descendants of X in G and can not
alter the marginals of nondescendants of

X.

It is possible of course that, for some peculiar parame­
ter changes, the marginal probabilities of some descen­
dants of X would not change. When recovering causal
information from distributional changes, we assume a
restriction on a TS called influentiality.
Definition 2 (infiuentiality) A

TP (P, Px)

gener­

ated by a causal model <G, 0a> is said to be influen­
tial if for every descendant Y of X in G, the marginal
distribution

Px (Y)

is different from

P(Y).

A TS is

influential if every TP in the sequence is influential.
Given a TP (P, Px) , and assuming that we can test
each variable for marginal distribution change, we can
draw the following inferences. If the marginal of a
variable Y has changed, we conclude that Y is a de­
scendant of X. If the marginal of a variable Z has
not changed, we conclude that Z is a nondescendant
of X. We thus conclude that Z < X < Y should be a
causal order consistent with the causal diagram. Next
we discuss how to piece together ordering information
of this kind, as obtained from a TS.

We classify variables into buckets with the following
algorithm.

Partitioning the variables

Given a TS PTS, F
(Viu .. , Vi.), each variable
can be characterized by a sequence of 1's and O's, a
tag a1, ... , a,_, where a1 reflects whether the marginal
of that variable changed (a; = 1) or not (ai = 0) in the
ith transition of the sequence. Non-focal variables that
are given the same tags cannot be distinguished by the
TS (through detecting marginal changes), and no in­
formation can therefore be extracted about their rela=

.

..•

We show the partitioning process by an example. As­
sume that the actual causal diagram is the DAG
shown in Figure 2(a) and that we are given a TS
(P, Px, Py ) . In the first transition, with X as the fo­
cal variable, P(Y) does not change, hence B0 = {Y};
P(X),P(Z),P(W),P(Q) do change, hence we form
B1 = {Z, W,Q}, B{ = {X }. Note that a focal vari­
able is put into an individual bucket. In the second
transition, withY as the focal variable, P(Y) changes,
giving B£1 = {Y}; P(Z) and P(W) change, giving
B11 = {Z, W }; P(Q) and P (X ) do not change, giving
Bw = {Q} and B{0 ={X}. As a result, the variables
are partitioned into four buckets: B{0 = {X},B61 =

{Y},B10

{Q}, Bn

=

{Z, W}.

Extracting causal information

4.2

We shall now discuss what causal information we can
extract from the tags attached to buckets. Consider
any two buckets B a1... 0�< and Bb1 h. If there exists
a bit such as ai < bi (i.e., ai = 0 and bi = 1), it
must be that, in the ith transition, the marginals of
variables in Ba1 ...a� did not change and the marginals
of variables in Bb1...b� did. Therefore, no variable in
Ba1 0� is a descendant of any variable in Bb1 bh On
the other hand, if there exists another bit such that
aj > bi (aj 1, bj 0), then no variable in Bh ·b�. is
a descendant of any variable in Ba1 . ak, which means
that there exists no directed path, in particular no
edge, between any variable in Ba1 · ak and any vari.

from those that only represent potential edges in the
causal diagram. This information is useful when the
child bucket B' contains only one variable; we then
assert that the edge B � B' must exist in the causal
diagram. We will call an OG with marked edges a
marked order graph (MOG); an example is shown in
Figure 2(c).
An algorithm for constructing a MOG is given in the
following.

Output: a marked order graph.

If the relation is "unknown", add an edge B-B'.

5. For each focal bucket Bf and each of its child B

If there is no other mixed directed path from Bf

to B, mark the edge as Bf �B.

In summary, the information conveyed by a MOG is
as follows:
1.

An unmarked edge B � B': All variables in B
can be ordered before all variables in B' in the
causal diagram, in other words, there are no di­
rected paths from variables in B1 to variables in
B. When B is a focal variable, there exists a di­
rected path from B to each variable in B' in the
causal diagram.

2. A marked edge B � B': There exists a directed
path from B to each variable in B'. In the case
that both B and B' contain one single variable,
the edge B ---+ B' must exist in the causal dia­
gram.

4.3

Limitation of detecting marginal changes

Can we fully recover a causal diagram by detecting
marginal distribution changes alone? To fully recover
a causal diagram, we must construct a MOG in which
each bucket contains only one variable and every edge
is marked. This may not, in general, be achieved.
Considering a causal diagram G containing a path
X ---+ Z ---+ Y, it is clear that we can never de­
termine if there is an edge X ---+ Y in G, since all
marginal changes produced by transitions would be
the same after adding that edge. What is the best we
can get then by detecting marginal changes?
Given a DAG G, if we remove an edge X --t Y when­
ever there is a directed path from X to Y, we get the
transitive reduction of G. The transitive reduction of
a DAG G is the graph G' with the fewest edges such
that the transitive closure of G' is equal to the transi­
tive closure of G. The transitive closure of a DAG G
is the graph G11 such that an edge X --t Y is in G11 iff
there is a directed path from X toY in G. By detect­
ing marginal changes in TS's, the best we can hope
to get is the transitive reduction of the actual causal
diagram. Since to mark an edge X ---+Y, X must be
a focal variable, it follows that every node except leaf
nodes must be a focal variable in order to mark ev­
ery edge in the transitive reduction graph. To further
make each bucket contain only one variable, every leaf
node having the same set of parents as another leaf
node must be a focal variable.
In conclusion, by detecting marginal distribution
changes, the best we can learn is the transitive reduc­
tion of the causal diagram, and we can achieve it by
a TS in which every variable has had its mechanism
changed.
4.4

Unknown focal variables

In this section we discuss si�uations where we know
that a mechanism change has occurred at a single vari­
able but we do not know the identity of that variable.
We first note that, without knowing the focal vari­
ables, variables can still be partitioned into buckets
using Algorithm 1, and the relations between pairs
of buckets will be determined by rules Rl-R3 of Sec­
tion 4.2. Second, an order graph can be constructed
as follows: for each pair of buckets B and B', there is
a directed edge B ---+ B' if B < B'. For the causal
diagram of Figure 3(a) and the TS (P,Px,Py), the
variables are partitioned into three buckets: B10
{X,Q},Bol
{Y},Bu = {Z, W}, and the OG is

shown in

Figure J(b).

Finally, we may be able to find to which bucket a focal
variable belongs using the following theorem, assuming
influentiality and perfect statistical tests. (We still call
such a bucket a "focal bucket", because it behaves as
a focal variable with the information at hand.)
Theorem 6 Let Si be the set of buckets for which
ai = 1 in their tags a1 . . . ak, then the focal bucket
pi for the jth transition is in Sj and for any other
bucket BE Si, pi< B.
Proof: Let the focal variable X for the jth transition

be tagged as a1 ak, then ai == 1, since P(X)
must change in this transition. All other variables
in the set of buckets Si must be descendants of X
since all their marginals changed in the jth tran­
sition. Therefore, whenever P(X) changes, their
marginals must change too, that is, if ai = 1 then
bi = 1 f or any variable tagged as b1 ... bk in Sj,
which leads to ai � b;, i == 1, ... , k. Hence for
any bucket Bbt . b& E Si not containing X, we have
D
Ba1 a� < Bb, bk·

. ..

In practice, Theorem 6 may fail to identify a focal
bucket when (due to imperfect statistical tests) there
exists no bucket pi in Sj satisfying pi < B for any
other bucket B E Si. In the case that an identified
focal bucket contains only one variable, we actually
identify a focal variable. For the OG in Figure 3(b),
the focal buckets for the first and second tr ansitions
can be found as B1 0 {X, Q} and B01 = {Y} respec­
tively, and we actually identify Y as the focal variable
of the second transition.
=

Finally we can get a MOG by marking edges as in
Algorithm 3. For our working example, the ideal MOG
is shown in Figure 3(c).
4.5

TSs absent of influentiality

If we allow for the possibility that a mechanism change
at X may not alter the marginal probabilities of some
of X's descendants, then detecting no change in P(Y)

UAI 2 001

provides no information on the causal relation between
X and Y. The information we may obtain is that de­
tecting a change in P(Y) means that Y is a descendant
of the focal variable X. First we partition variables
into tagged buckets using Algorithm 1. Then the re­
lationship among buckets is determined as: let Bi be
the focal bucket for the ith transition; Bi < Ba1 ... a�
if ai = 1, where "<" represents that all variables in
Ba1 Cik are descendants of the focal variable B'. Fi­
nally we compute the transitive closure of <: relation,
denoted by <*, to get more information. Simultane­
ous B <* B' and B' <* B would mean change detec­
tion errors and the relation between B and B' will be
declared as unknown. The information conveyed by
B <• B' is that all variables in B' are descendants of
the focal variable B in the underlying causal diagram.
•••

It is clear that if the identities of the focal variables
are not given, we can not get any order information
from a TS by detecting marginal changes.

Combining Static and Dynamic
Information

In Section 4, we discussed how to extract causal infor­
mation given a TS by detecting distributional changes.
In this section, we briefly describe how to comb ine
this information with that obtained from independence
tests.
Given data from a static stable distribution, we

can recover (partially directed) causal diagrams us­

ing conditional independence tests. Several such
algorithms have been developed, including IC al­
gorithm [Pearl, 2000, section 2.5] (initially intro­
duced in [Pearl and Verma, 1991]) and PC algo­
rithm (Spi rtes et al., 1993]. The output of these algo­
rithms is a partially oriented graph representing an
independence-equivalence class as defined by Theo­
rem 1.
To recover a causal diag ram from a TS, we first extract
causal information by detecting distribution changes
as described in Section 4, then run the IC algorithm
using the causal information as prior knowledge. Note
that since a TS is composed of a series of different dis­
tributions, we need to test independence relationships

across all distributions.
We may obtain three types of causal information as
shown in Section 4: causal order among certain vari­
ables, no edges between certain variables, and cer­
tain directed edges. The last two types (no-edge and
determined-edge) can be incorporated directly. Causal
order information can be used to restrict the search of
candidate conditional sets and thus reduce the com­
plexity of the IC algorithm. Causal order information

UAI2001

can also be used to orient more edges: any undirected

edge X-Y can be oriented as X --+ Y if X is ahead
of Y in the causal order. These methods of incorpo­

In our experiments, we used data generated from
a known network, the Alarm Bayesian network1
[Beinlich et al., 1989]. Samples used in the experiment
were generated from the network using a demo version
of Netica API developed by Norsys Software Corpo­
ration. We used equal sample sizes for all datasets
in a TS, that is, a sample size N represents that N
cases were generated for each dataset Di in lilTs =
{Do, . . . , D k } .

Errors in detecting changes

There are two types of errors in detecting changes: (i)
mistaking "no-change" for a "change" , known as type I
error and denoted NC2C, and (ii) mistaking "change"
as "no-change" , known as type II error and denoted
C2NC . Let G be the causal diagram used for gener­
ating samples. When a mechanism change occurs at

a variable Vi , if our test statistics is perfect, all Vi 's
descendants in G should be identified as "change" and
Vi's nondescendants as "no-change" . Let Deci be the
number of descendants of Vi in G and N D eci be the
number of nondescendants of Vi . Let c2nci be the
number of descendants of Vi identified as "no-change"
by the x2 test, and let nc2ci be the number of nonde­
scendants of Vi identified as "change" . nc2ci a,nd c2nc;
represent the number of type I and type II mistakes
made by the x2 statistics. In any one run, we simulate
a mechanism change at each node Vi , i = 1 , . . . , n, rel­
ative to the original network, and compute the C2NC
error rate as Li c2nc; j L; Deci and the NC2C error
rate as Li nc2c; j L; NDec;. We computed an aver­
age error rate over 5 runs.
We varied the change magnitude o, the sample size,
and the significance level o:, and the results are shown
in Figure 4. We see that the NC2C (type I) error
rate is nearly the same as the o: value for different
change magnitudes and sample sizes, as expected. The
C2NC (type II) error could be large when the a value
is small or the change magnitude is small. This sug­
gests that we should consider using a two-tailed x2 test
[Silverstein et al., 2000] to control the C2NC error, es­
pecially when the sample size is not large. In a two­
tailed x2 test, we use another threshold o:1 > a such
that we decide "no-change" only when x2 < X�, , but
we have to decide "unknown" when x!, < x2 < x! ­
We will not discuss this method in this paper.

Errors in order graphs

In an OG, an edge B ---+ B' represents that all vari­
ables in B can be causally ordered before the vari­
ables in B' . We call this type of information "order
claims" . No edge between B and B1 represents the
absence of directed paths, in particular edges, between
variables in B and those in B1; this information will
be called "no-directed-path (NDP) claims" and "no­
edge claims" respectively. An edge B-B' only signals
mistakes in the statistical tests and will be called "un­
known claims" . We performed the following experi-
