We have previously reported a Bayesian algorithm for
determining the coordinates of points in three­
dimensional space from uncertain constraints. This
method is useful in the determination of biological
molecular structure. It is limited, however, by the
requirement that the uncertainty in the constraints be
normally distributed. In this paper, we present an
extension of the original algorithm that allows
constraint uncertainty to be represented as a mixture
of Gaussians, and thereby allows arbitrary constraint
distributions. We illustrate the performance of this
algorithm on a problem drawn from the domain of
molecular structure determination, in which a
multicomponent constraint representation produces a
much more accurate solution than the old single
component mechanism. The new mechanism uses
mixture distributions to decompose the problem into
a set of independent problems with unimodal
constraint uncertainty. The results of the unimodal
subproblems are periodically recombined using
Bayes' law, to avoid combinatorial explosion. The
new algorithm is particularly suited for parallel
implementation.

INTRODUCTION

Determining spatial coordinates from uncertain constraints
is a problem that arises in many contexts, including the
definition of biological molecular structure. Biological
macromolecules (such as proteins or nucleic acids) contain
hundreds to thousands of atoms, whose three-dimensional
arrangements constitute their structure. The determination
of molecular structure is critical for many pursuits in
biomedicine, including the study of how molecules
perform their function, and the design of drugs to augment
or interfere with these functions. The primary sources of
information about molecular structure are experimental,
theoretical and empirical/statistical ( Stryer 1991).
However, of the 100,000 protein molecules that are
estimated to be made within the human organism, the
structures of only about 500 are known. The paucity of
known structures derives, in part, from the great difficulty
and expense of collecting experimental data of sufficient
quantity and quality to allow each atom to be positioned

accurately in three dimensions. In addition, theoretical
and statistical constraints on structure (derived from
biophysical models or from analysis of the previously
determined structures, respectively) are also not
sufficiently abundant or accurate to provide high
resolution structural models by themselves.
In
combination, however, these data sources sometimes
provide enough information to define the overall shape of
a molecule or some elements of a high resolution
structure.
The focus of this work is to develop
algorithms that are able to process uncertain data from
multiple sources in order to produce an accurate model of
a molecule.
Because the sources of data are uncertain (and in low
abundance) the problem of defining structure is
underdetermined. It is therefore necessary to estimate not
merely a single structure that is consistent with the
provided constraints, but also the variability in this
structure. We have therefore developed an algorithm that
is specifically geared towards providing estimates of
structures as well as their uncertainty (Altman and
Jardetzky 1989; Altman 1993). The algorithm represents
a structure as a vector of mean coordinates, along with a
variance/covariance matrix that summarizes the
uncertainties in these coordinates. The random vector of
mean values for Cartesian coordinates, x, is of length 3N
for N atoms:
x

=

[XI Y1 Zl X2 Y2 Z2

•

•

•

XN YN ZNrl

[1]

The vector of mean values of x, x, is also of length 3N.
The variance/covariance matrix is of size 3N x 3N. The
diagonal elements contain the variance of each of the
elements of the mean vector. The off-diagonal elements
contain the covariances between these elements:

C(x)=

[2]
The mean vector and covariance matrix provide estimates
of
the positions, and summarize the the three­
dimensional uncertainty of the atoms, as shown in Figure
I. The process of finding the optimal values for the
parameters within the mean vector and covariance matrix
is driven by external constraints on their values.

16

Altman, Chen, Poland, and Singh

Constraints on structure have two components: a
deterministic component, h(x), that is a function of the
coordinate vector, and an independent random component,
v, (normally distributed, with mean of zero and variance
of C(v)) describing the uncertainty in the value of the
constraint, z:
z=h(x)+v
z-

Jlz

N{fl

=

z,

[3]

C(h(x)) + C(v)

[4]
[5]

When we say that constraint z has a normal distribution,
we are implying that it can be described by a Gaussian
distribution with mean value taken from experimental,
statistical or theoretical measurements, and variance C(v)
which is a property of the measurement technology.
Thus, for example, one kind of constraint that is
commonly used for determining molecular structure is the
distance between atoms as measured by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments. An NMR experiment
might reveal that two atoms (i andj) have a mean distance

of 5 Angstroms, with a variance of 2 A2. In this case,
the function h(x) is the scalar distance function, which
depends on the three coordinates of the atoms i and j. v is
the random variable that represents the error in the NMR
measurement, normally distributed around 0 with
variance of 2 A2. The mean value of z, Jlz, is 5.

�(x;-xjr+(Y;-Y )2

(z;-zj )2 + v

[6]

Thus, given a model of the structure, which comprises the
elements xand C(x), we can compute an expected value
for the distance and compare it with the measured value in
the context of the expected noise, v, to see if they are
compatible. If they are compatible, then we gain
incremental confidence in our model, and the variances in
C(x) are reduced. If they are incompatible, then we make
an appropriate update to our model ( xand C(x)) to reflect
the new information.
In previous work, we have shown that the model update
can proceed in a Bayesian fashion, based on a modification
of the extended, iterated Kalman filter (Gelb 1984) with
measurement updates but no time updates.
To
summarize, a random starting
and C(x) are created,
with variances that are large (and consistent with the
overall expected size of the molecule). Covariances are
set to zero. Constraints are introduced serially and used
to update both xand C(x). The update equations are
given by:

If a set of uncertain distance constraints are used to update
an estimate of xand C(x), then the resulting new values
of i and C(x) will better "satisfy" the distance
constraints (Altman 1993) . Satisfaction is measured as
the difference between the expected value of a constraint
()lz,) and the observed value within the structural model

[8]
and

[11]
Because of inaccuracies introduced by the linearization of
h(x) shown in Equation 10, the simple serial
introduction of the constraints does not converge to the
best solution.
However, if we use the new value of
xafter one round of introducing constraints as an
improved starting point and repeat the procedure of
introducing constraints iteratively, then we converge to a
solution that satisfies all the constraints. We discuss the
details of this iteration, and the similarity of our
procedure, in some aspects, to simulated annealing in
(Altman 1993). The resulting structural estimate provides
both the mean value of the coordinates of each atom (in
the xvector) and the uncertainty in these values (the
diagonal of C(x)) and the covariation between these
coordinates.
This enables us to create structural
illustrations such as shown in Figure 1 that demonstrate
structure and level of uncertainty.
The procedure described above, assuming Gaussian
constraint error, has been applied successfully to problems
of analyzing uncertain experimental data (Arrowsmith,
Pachter et al. 1991) and predicting structure from
uncertain theoretical constraints (Altman 1993).
The
chief limitation has been that there are many sources of
data that do not have normally distributed noise. As a
result, the unimodal algorithm cannot accurately handle
many cases of practical interest. For example, some
types of theoretical constraints provide information that
the distance between two points may be distributed in a
trimodal manner.l A simple model of this constraint as a
normal distribution is inadequate for capturing the
information contained within the constraint. There are
values that may appear likely in a Gaussian representation
that actually fall between modes and are not likely. We
have extended the algorithm to relax the assumption that
all constraints have unimodal noise. The key insight is
that any constraint can be approximated by a mixture of
Gaussian distributions, which allows each of the
components (unmixed Gaussians) to be treated by the
original unimodal algorithm. We determine the number
of components, and the mean values, variances and
weights of each component in the mixture distributions,
by the algorithms described in (R:hrlmShafm 1993 ).

[9]
[10]

1 Such a constraint might arise when the distance is conditioned on
information that would allow one of three Gaussians to be selected (but that is
unknown). and so the three possible components must be combined into a

trimodal marginal distribution.

Probabilistic Constraint Satisfaction with Non-Gaussian Noise

Figure 1. (LEFf) Typical output of the algorithm; We show here a fragment of a biological molecule with 21 atoms.
Each atom has an uncertainty in three-dimensions described by an ellipsoid drawn at 2 standard deviations. Atomic

bonds that connect two chemically adjacent atoms are drawn as lines (and are roughly 3.8 A in length). Large ellipsoids
indicate greater uncertainty in atomic location, and that atomic positions are less well defined by the constraints. The

center of each ellipsoid is drawn at the mean position for each coordinate of the atom. The ellipsoid parameters are taken
from the variance/covariance matrix which summarizes the uncertainties in the mean coordinates.

Although the structure produced by the unimodal algorithm has some general similarity

to the gold standard structure,

it has significant areas of mismatch. This mismatch illustrates the difficulties in

reconstructing high resolution structures assuming a single component for all constraint noise.

When detailed

information about the distribution of constraint noise is available, these results suggest that it should be used. (RIGHT)

however, generating all possible component combinations

Instead, we generate combinations of

We then solve each of these "partial"

prohibitive.

to detect the correct solution as the weights of the
spurious components increased, we generated two
additional multicomponent constraint sets (along with the
equivalent unimodal constraints as described for the
previous experiment):

from 0.0 to 50.0 and variances chosen from 0.0 to 10.0.
The remaining weight was again distributed evenly.
Now, however, approximately 30% of the constraints did
not have a majority of the weight on the actual
component. Once again, the unimodal algorithm was
run on a random starting structure, and reached a plateau at
an average error of 1.8 SD and maximum error of 12.3
SD. This solution was 15.7 A RMSD from the known
structure.
Using this as a starting p oint, the
multicomponent algorithm converged to an average error
of 0.003 (maximum error 0.03). The resulting structure
matched the gold standard to an RMSD of 0.002 A.

finding the most likely posterior modes for a random
variable, given Gaussian constraints (Shachter, Eddy et al.
1990) which is similar to the unimodal algorithm, but
does not employ a reheating strategy to exit local
minima. Our work differs in that it focuses specifically
on non-Gaussian constraints. The new multicomponent
