The paper presents a method for reducingthe
computational complexity of Bayesian net­
works through identification and removal of
weak dependences (removal of links from the
(moralized) independence graph). The re­
moval of a small number of links may re­
duce the computational complexity dramat­
ically, since several fill-ins and moral links
may be rendered superfluous by the removal.
The method is described in terms of im­
pact on the independence graph, the junc­
tion tree, and the potential functions associ­
ated wit h these. An empirical evaluation of
the method using large real-world networks
demonstrates the applicability ofthe method.
Further, the method, which has been imple­
mented in Hugin, complements the approxi­
mation method suggested by Jensen & An­
dersen (1990).

INTRODUCTION

bronchitis and lung cancer (shorthand: b Jl l), and
between coughing and lung cancer (c Jl l). It might,
however, be quite sensible to replace c Jl l with
c Jl ll (b, d); that is,
conditional independence be­
tween coughing and lung cancer given bronchitis and
dyspnoea. The independence graph of this alterna­
tive model could be achieved through replacement of
the directed link from coughing to dyspnoea with an
undirected one, whereby the chain graph of Figure 1b
emerges. Semantically, this implies that the relation­
ship between coughing and dyspnoea is non-causal.
(Note that an independence graph equivalent to that
of Figure 1b might be obtained by simple reversal of
the directed link from coughing to dyspnoea.)

and lung cancer in part (a) results in the 'less demand­
ing' independence graph of part (b).

Decision making in domains wit h inherent uncertainty
using Bayesian (belief) networks and exact computa­
tions often involve very high dimensional probability
tables. Hence, for many practical problems, exact
computations are prohibitive. Therefore, approximate
solutions are often the best that can be hoped for.
Such solutions can be provided through simulation or
model simplification. We shall address the latter, al­
though methods of the former type shall play an im­
portant role in our approach, which involves enforce­
ment of additional conditional independence assump­
tions through removal of links from the moralized in­
dependence graph.

Specification of conditional probabilities for model (a)
involves a four-dimensional table for (d I b, c, l) and a
two-dimensional one for (c I b), whereas for model (b)
it suffices to specify two three-dimensional tables, one
for (c, d Ib) and one for (d I b, l). If, for example, each of
the four variables is described in terms of five discrete
states, this meansthat model (a) requires specification
of 4 53 + 4 5 = 520 conditional probabilities, whereas
model (b) requires 'only' 24 5 + 4 52
220.

To illustrate the approach, consider the following toy
example. Assume that dyspnoea (shortness of breath)
(d) can be caused by one or more of the 'diseases'
coughing (c) , bronchitis (b), and lung cancer (l), and
further that bronchitis causes coughing (Figure la).
This model suggests marginal independence between

Briefly, the method provides a systematic way of per­
forming model transformations as illustrated in Fig­
ure 1 such that one additional conditional indepen­
dence assumption is explicitly being enforced (and pos­
sibly some implicit ones, which follow naturally) and
such that an (sub)optimal balance between reduction

Usingthe suggested approximation method, model (b)
can be obtained from model (a) by removal of the
moral link between coughing and lung cancer.

of computational complexity and approximation er­
ror is achieved. A candidate new (explicit) assump­
tion takes the form a ll /31 C \ {a, /3}, where C is a
clique in a junction tree corresponding to an indepen­
dence graph Q, such that a and f3 are connected in
the moral graph corresponding to Q and such that C
is the unique clique containing both a and /3. That
is, the method aims at splitting (large) cliques into
smaller ones while keeping a small 'distance' between
the exact and the approximate distributions. This
distance is computed using either exact or simulated
clique potentials of a (imaginary) junction tree, where
the storage requirements of simulated potentials, ob­
tained through Monte-Carlo sampling, depends only
linearly on both the clique size and the sample size.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reviews the key features of graphical chain models and
junction trees necessary for the presentation. Section 3
presents the method, including descriptions of its im­
pact on the junction tree, the independence graph, and
the potential functions associated with these. Please
note that the results are stated without proofs; the in­
terested reader is referred to Kjrerulff (1993). Section 4
demonstrates the applicability of the method by pre­
senting some results of applying it on large real-world
networks. Section 5 summarizes the features of the
presented approach and argues that it complements
the approach of Jensen & Andersen (1990).

the optimal link to remove and a presentation of the
implications of link removal in terms of correctness of
inference, the reader is referred to Kjrerulff (1993).

GRAPHICAL CHAIN MODELS
AND JUNCTION TREES

The term Bayesian networks has traditionally been
used as a synonym for recursive graphical models
(Wermuth & Lauritzen 1983) for which the indepen­
dence structure is encoded by directed acyclic graphs.
In the present paper we shall, however, use 'Bayesian
networks' as a synonym for the more general class
of models denoted graphical chain models (Lauritzen
& Wermuth 1984, Lauritzen & Wermuth 1989) for
which the independence structure is encoded by chain
graphs. Notice that the class of graphical chain models
also contains the subclass of graphical models (Dar­
roch, Lauritzen & Speed 1980) with independence
structure encoded by undirected graphs.
2.1

CHAIN GRAPHS

In the following the notion of chain graphs shall be
reviewed briefly and fairly informally. For a more
thorough treatment of the subject see e.g. Frydenberg
( 1989).
Let Q
(V, E = Ed U Eu) be a graph with nodes
(vertices) V and links (edges) E � V x V, where Ed
=

=

375

{(a, {3) E E I (/3, o:) ¢ E} is the subset of directed
links and Eu
{(a, {3) E E I (/3, a) E E} the subset
of undirected links. If there is a link between o: and
{3, denoted a,...., {3, they are said to be connected. A
directed link between a and f3 is denoted a ---t f3 or
a+- {3, and an undirected link is denoted a - {3. We
shall use a "' {3, etc. to denote either 'a and f3 are
connected' or 'the link between a and /3' depending
on the context.
=

A path (a
a1, ... , O:k
/3) from o: to {3 in Q is an
ordered sequence of distinct nodes such that ai "'O:i+1
for each i = 1, ... , k - 1. The path is undirected if
1, . . . , k - 1. The path is directed if
a- {3 for each i
either a-{3 or ai ---t ai+l for each i = 1, .. . , k - 1 and
the path includes at least one directed link. A cycle is
a path 1r = ( o: = a1, ... , ak = /3) with the exception
that o: = {3.
=

=

=

For A, B, C � V, C is said to separate A from B if
for all paths (a = a1,
, ak = /3), where a E A and
f3 E B, {at, ... ,ak} n C =10. A graph Q is connected
if there is a path between each pair of nodes of Q.
Unless otherwise stated, connectivity shall henceforth
be assumed.
•

•

.

Now, Q is a chain graph if it contains no directed cycles. If Q is a chain graph, then { K1, ... , Kn} are
called the chain components of Q if {K1, ... , Kn} is
the set of connected components of (V, Eu). There
are two important special classes of chain graphs. If
n = lVI (i.e., one node per chain component), Q is
called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). If n = 1, Q is
called an undirected graph.
A subset A � V induces a subgraph QA = (A, EA) of
Q, where EA = En (A x A). (Note that any subgraph
of a chain graph is a chain graph.) A graph is complete
if all nodes are pairwise connected. A subset A c;::; V
is complete if it induces a complete subgraph, and if
A is maximal (i.e., there is no complete subset B c;::; V
such that A C B), then it is called a clique.
The parents of A� V is the subset pa(A) � V \ A such
that for each f3 E pa(A) there is an a E A for which
f3 -t a. The set of children of A, denoted ch(A), is
defined analogously. The neighbours of A is the subset
nb(A) � V \A such that for each f3 E nb(A) there is
an a E A for which a-{3. The ancestral set of A c;::; V
is the subset An( A) � V such that for each f3 E An( A)
either f3 E A or there is a directed or undirected path
from f3 to at least one o: E A.
The moral graph gm of a chain graph Q is obtained
by first adding undirected links between each pair of
unconnected nodes in pa(K) for each chain component
K, and then replacing all directed links by undirected
ones.
An undirected graph Q = (V, E) is triangulated (also:
decomposable or chordal) if each cycle of length greater
than 3 has a chord (i.e., a link between two non­
consecutive nodes of the cycle).

GRAPHICAL CHAIN MODELS

For a chain graph Q = (V, E) we consider a collection
of discrete random variables (Xa)aEV taking values
in probability spaces Sp(Xa)- For brevity we shall
interchangeably refer to a E V as both a node and a
variable. Thus we shall write e.g. a instead of Xa. For
a subset A s;;; V we let Sp(A) = XaEASp(a) (i.e., the
Cartesian product of the state spaces of the variables
in A).
A probability function p = pv is said to factorize ac­
cording to a chain graph Q = (V, E) if there exist non­
negative functions ¢>A defined on Sp(A) such that
p ex

II ¢>A,

(1)

AEA

where A is the set of cliques of g=. The functions ¢>A
shall be called component potentials of p. For Q being
a DAG this simplifies to
p=

p(v I pa(v)).

A similar factorization exists in the general case. Let

P=

KEIC

(4)

where JC is the set of chain components of Q.
If p factorizes according to Q, then Q is said to be an in­
dependence graph of p, and p is a graphical chain model
(a probability function of a Bayesian network with Q
as underlying graph). (The phrase 'p is Markov with
respect to Q' is a synonym for 'p factorizes according
to Q'.)
In the special case of Q = (V, E) being a DAG all
conditional independence statements captured by Q
can be found using the d-separation criterion of Pearl
(1988) or the equivalent criterion of Lauritzen, Dawid,
Larsen & Leimer (1990). But in the general case
the Markov properties (i.e., conditional independence
properties) captured by g are expressed by the follow­
ing theorem (Frydenberg 1989).
Theorem 1

Let p factorize according to a chain
graph, Q = (V, E). Then A ll BI C with respect to
p for any subsets A, B, C � V whenever C separates
A from B in ( Q An(AuBuo})m.

Note that the formulation of this theorem, describing
the global chain Markov property, is identical to the
theorem of Lauritzen et al. (1990) describing the di­
rected global Markov property for recursive graphical
models (i.e., where Q is a DAG).

JUNCTION TREES

By exploiting the conditional independence relations
among the variables of a Bayesian network, the under­
lying joint probability space may be decomposed into a
set of subspaces corresponding to a decomposable (hy­
pergraph) cover of the moralized graph such that exact
inference can be performed by simple message passing
in a maximal spanning tree of the cover (Lauritzen &
Spiegelhalter 1988, Jensen 1988, Jensen, Lauritzen &
Olesen 1990). Technically, a decomposable cover of
a Bayesian network with underlying chain graph 9 is
created by triangulating gm (i.e., adding undirected
links, so-called fill-ins, to gm to make it triangulated).
That is, the set of cliques of the triangulated graph is
a decomposable cover of the network.
Jensen (1988) has shown that any maximal spanning
tree of a decomposable cover, C, can be used as the
basis for a simple inward/outward message-passing
scheme for propagation of evidence (belief updating)
in Bayesian networks, where maximality is defined in
terms of the sum of cardinalities of the intersections
between adjacent nodes (cliques) of the tree. Jensen
named these trees junction trees. The intersections be­
tween neighbouring cliques of a junction tree are called
separators (Jensen et al. 1990).
We shall henceforth refer to a junction tree by the pair
(C, S) of cliques and separators. It can be shown that
for each path (C C1, . , Ck D) in a junction tree,
c n D s;;; ci for all 1 :::; i :::; k, implying that A ll B I s
for each S E S, where A and Bare the sets of variables
of the two subtrees (except S) induced by the removal
of the link corresponding to S {Jensen 1988).

To each clique and each separator is associated a belief

ENFORCING INDEPENDENCE
ASSUMPTIONS

The computational complexity imposed by a particu­
lar junction tree (C, S) is roughly determined by the

clique, C E C, with the largest state space. Thus by
splitting C into smaller cliques a significant reduction
of the computational complexity might be obtained.
If { o:, ,8} � C such that there is no other clique in C
containing {o:, ,8}, then adding o: ll ,81 C \ { o:, ,8} to
the set of independence statements amounts to split­
C \ {o:}, which
ting C into Ca. = C \ {,8} and Cf3
might or might not become new cliques of the modified
junction tree (see the examples of Figure 2).

alently, that the graph obtained by removing o:-,8 in
the triangulated graph corresponding to (C, S) is tri­

AN EXAMPLE

To understand the main issues of the proposed ap­
proximation method we shall present a small example.
Consider the sample chain graph of Figure 3a with
corresponding moral graph of Figure 3b (solid links).
The dashed link is a fill-in added to make the graph
triangulated. The junction tree corresponding to the
triangulated graph of Figure 3b is shown in Figure 4a.

induce several new independence statements (c ll d,
d ll e, a ll dIe, etc.) which do not follow as natural
consequences of c ll d I (a, e). The set of independence
statements displayed by each chain graph of Figure 5
is a subset of I*
I U { c ll d I (a, e)}. This follows
from the fact that the three moral graphs are identical
to the moral graph of Figure 3b with c-d removed.
Thus, each graph of Figure 5 is a correct representation
of I*, but none of the graphs are perfect representa­
tions, since they fail to represent e.g. the statements
d ll e I c and a ll e I b.

Figure 3: (a) Sample independence graph. (b) Corre­
sponding moral graph (solid links) and a triangulated
graph (all links).

Notice that the moral graph corresponding to the
graphs of Figure 5 is triangulated. This eliminates
the need for the fill-in between a and c, allowing
clique {a, b, c, e} to be split into the two smaller cliques
{a, b, e} and {b, c, e} (Figure 4c). In general, a possi­
bly large number of fill-ins and moral links might be
rendered redundant by the removal of a single link. If,
for example, b-+ e is removed in Figure 3a, the moral
link b-e disappears.

Reduction of the computational complexity of the
junction tree could be accomplished by extending the
set of conditional independence statements displayed
by the tree. Adding e.g. the statement c ll d I (a, e)
(i.e., removal of c- d from the triangulated graph)
causes clique {a, c, d, e} to split into the sets {a, d, e}
and {a, c, e} neither of which appear to be cliques of
the reduced graph (Figure 4b).

Enforcement of the conditional independence state­
ment c ll d I (a, e) thus provided a reduction of com­
plexity in terms of sizes of cliques from three 4-cliques
(i.e., cliques of four variables) to one 4-clique and two
3-cliques. This corresponds to at least a 37% reduction
of space requirements (binary variables) even though
the resulting independence graph(s) at first glance
seems more 'complicated'.

Since we wish to add just one statement to the set I

OUTLINE OF METHOD

The above example provided insight into some of the
issues related to the approximation method. Before

378

Kj�rulff

presenting the technicalities of the method, let us sum­
marize the underlying philosophy and list the issues to
be dealt with in more detail.

'1/Js = ¢s. That is, the potentials of the (possible) new
cliques are ¢C\{a} and cPC\{f3}• and the potentials of
the cliques in

W hen attempts to compile a Bayesian network into a
junction tree fails on account of excessive memory re­
quirements, the problems are often caused by a small
number of cliques. The proposed method is based on
the idea of splitting these cliques into smaller ones (i.e.,
extending the set of independence statements). There­
fore, the first step is to create a junction tree with exact
or simulated clique potentials. (Although exact clique
potentials can be created, there might still be a wish to
reduce the space requirements if this can be done with­
out attaining an unacceptable level of imprecision.)
Clique potentials (whether exact or simulated) must
be provided such that the deviation between these 'cor­
rect' potentials and the approximate ones can be com­
puted. These measures of deviation (or distance) must
then be used as the basis of a criterion for selecting the
link to be removed.
Simulated clique potentials can be provided through
various kinds of Monte-Carlo simulation like Gibbs
sampling and 'forward sampling' which have complex­
ities proportional to the moral graph. We shall not
discuss this issue any further, even though there are
some interesting points concerning optimal choice of
simulation method, especially when the underlying in­
dependence graph is not a DAG.

posable hypergraph cover of gm), and (4) a poten­
tial representation of p based on belief potentials (cf.

Equation (5)). Notice that it suffices to include one
of the potential representations for an exhaustive de­
scription of a Bayesian network. We shall, however,
include them both as a matter of convenience.
We shall now detail the impacts on these four compo­
nents when removing a"'/3 from the moral graph.

the independence properties of PV\{a} cannot be rep­
resented by a single chain graph. If we want a perfect
representation, a more sophisticated language must be
adopted. One such language may be given by the class
of annotated graphs (Geva & Paz 1992). However, in
the present paper we shall refrain from pursuing this
any further.
Theorem 2 provides a method for constructing an in­
dependence graph of the marginal distribution PV \{a}·
However, the construction of an independence graph of
the approximate joint belief 'ljJ = ¢Aus¢B 1 s involves
combination of a marginal independence graph and a
conditional (marginal) independence graph.1 The in­
dependence graph of the conditional distribution Pv 1 a
is obtained simply by moralizing the subgraph induced
by An(a) and removing a and the links incident to it.
Let the chain graph Q = (V, E) be an in­
dependence graph of p = Pv and let
be the links
of t9An(A))m. Then Q' = (V, E U EA.';,( A)) is a chain
graph and a conditional independence graph of Pv 1 A.

Theorem 3

EAn(A)

By the methods of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 we can
construct any marginal independence graph (possibly
conditional on a set of variables) by successive removal
of the relevant variables.
Note that the presence of the set A and the links
incident to A in the independence graph of Pv 1 A is
unnecessary for a correct interpretation of the condi­
tional independence relations among variables in V \A

a marginal distribution as a marginal independence graph,

and similarly for the conditional case.

given A. However, when combining a conditional and
a marginal independence graph to obtain a joint in­
dependence graph, A and some links connecting A to
V \ A are needed. In fact, when constructing a condi­
tional independence graph we shall proceed as follows.
Let p and 9' be given as in Theorem 3.
The graph obtained by (i) removing all links between
nodes in S and (ii} making all links between S and

Returning to the example in Section 3.1, we iden­
tify the sets A = {a, b, c,e}, B = {a,d,e, !}, and
S = {a,e}. Following the above results we deter­
mine a marginal independence graph and a conditional
one, and then combine these into a new joint inde­
pendence graph. This combination can involve one of
three principally different sets of marginal and con­
ditional graphs: (1) marginal graph for AU S plus
conditional one for B IS, (2) marginal graph forB US
plus conditional one for A IS, or (3) conditional graphs
for A I S and B I S plus marginal one for S, reflecting
the factorizations 7/J = rPAuSrPB 1 s, 7/J = rPA 1 srPBus,
and 7/J
¢A 1 s¢B 1 st/Js, respectively. The relevant
marginal and conditional graphs are a-+e for S and
the ones of Figure 8. Forming the independence graph
of 7/J through graph union, we find the three possi­
ble solutions displayed in Figure 5a-c corresponding,
respectively, to combination alternatives (1)-(3) with
the modifications that a-d (solutions (a) and (c))
and a-b (solutions (b) and (c)) have been replaced
with a-+ d and a-+b to avoid directed cycles. (Note
that these modifications do not alter the represented
independence statements.) Since we shall prefer so­
lutions representing the largest sets of independence
statements, there is a clear preference order among
the three alternatives (solution (a) is preferable to so­
lution (b) which is preferable to solution (c)).

Theorem 4 below states that a joint independence

ditional and a marginal independence graph.

graph (i.e., it contains directed cycle(s)}, replace links

9' becomes a chain graph. Then 9' is an independence
graph of p. Further, 9' is perfect if both 9ius and

COMPONENT POTENTIALS

Given a joint belief, 7/J, and a chain graph, 9, obtained
through enforcement of one or more conditional inde­
pendence assumptions, we wish to determine an asso­
ciated set of component potentials. Furthermore, we
have available a set of belief potentials associated with
a junction tree corresponding to 9.
Notice that if 7/J and 9 are produced as described in
Sections 3.3-3.5, 7/J is guaranteed to factorize according
to 9. That is, there exist component potentials �A such
that 7/J ex nA �A (cf. Equation (1)).
Following Equation (3) the problem can be divided
into n subproblems, where n is the number of chain
components of 9.
More specifically, since 'ljJ =
n 7/J(K I pa(K)), we must determine potentials �A for
each chain component K such that

=

A similar analysis can be performed for the dyspnoea
example in the Introduction. Again there appears to
be a clear preference order among the solutions, with
the optimal solution displayed in Figure 1b.

(cf. Equation (4)), where K+ = K U pa(K) and AK
is the set of cliques in (9K+ ) m containing at least one
node in K. Notice that, since belief potentials are
available, 7/J K+ can be computed.
The potentials �A can be found via Mobius inversion
when 7/JK+ is positive; see e.g. Lauritzen & Wermuth
(1989). Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. How­
ever, it seems plausible that an extended version of
the Mobius inversion exists when 7/JK+ is known to
factorize according to 9.
Lauritzen & Wermuth (1984) has shown that for any
decomposable graphical chain model there exists an
equivalent recursive model; that is, if (9K+ )m is tri­
angulated for each K. Thus, if 9 is decompos­
able, we may generate the equivalent DAG and com­
pute conditional probabilities (component potentials)
7/J (v I pa(v)) (cf. Equation (2)). If 9 is not decompos­
able, we may triangulate each subgraph (9K+ ) m by

Link Removal in Bayesian Networks

inserting fill-ins and then generate a DAG, 9*, from
the resulting graph. In the latter case the resulting
recursive model will be suboptimal in two ways. First,
9* fails to represent all the independence statements
represented by 9. Second, the computational complex­
ity imposed by the optimal triangulation of (9*)m is
at least as large as the computational complexity im­
posed by the optimal triangulation of gm, since the
triangulation of each (9K+ ) m 'constrains' the triangu­
lation.

EXPERIMENTS

Since, from a theoretical point of view, not much can
said about the practical importance of link removal,
we shall now report on some results of an empirical
study conducted on a number of real-world networks.
The networks are Pathfinder (Heckerman, Horvitz &
Nathwani 1992) (including 109 nodes) for diagnosing
lymph node pathology, two subnetworks of MUNIN
(Andreassen, Woldbye, Falck & Andersen 1987) (in­
cluding about 190 nodes each) for diagnosing disor­
ders in the peripheral nervous system, and a time­
sliced network model of the biological processes of a
water treatment plant including 32 process variables
(Jensen, Kjcerulff, Olesen & Pedersen 1989).
The criterion applied for selecting a link a""' (3 to be re­
moved from a clique C is based on the reduction of the
total state space and the 'distance' between the exact,
¢c , and the approximate, 1/Jc , clique potentials. The
distance, D(¢c,1/Jc ), is measured as the conditional
mutual information between a and (3 given C \ {a, (3}
(also: the Kullback-Leibler divergence between ¢c and
1/Jc) given as
I ( a,(JI C \ {a,(J}) = D(¢c ,'l/Jc)

=

Elog(¢c Nc )

with expectation taken with respect to ¢, and where
'1/Jc = 0. A useful relationship
= 0 when ¢c
between the absolute divergence and the Kullback­
Leibler divergence (see e.g. Kullback (1967)) states
that

for any A � C.
In the experiments links with lower mutual informa­
tion were preferred, and savings (reduction of state
space) were used only to break ties. Further, links
were removed until a total divergence of at most 0.001
was reached (the total divergence after a series of re­
movals equals the sum of the individual divergences
(Kjcerulff 1993)). Using Inequality (8) the theoreti­
cally upper bound on the absolute error is found to
be 2%.
Table 1 displays the results. The 'size' of a net­
work equals the sum of the sizes of the state spaces
of the cliques after sensible triangulation. For all
networks except MUNIN2 the Kullback-Leibler diver­
gences were computed using exact clique potentials.

For the MUNIN2 network simulated potentials based
on 10, 000 iterations of forward sampling were used.

The savings obtained for the Pathfinder and the
MUNINl networks are relatively modest, whereas sig­
nificant savings are obtained for the MUNIN2 and the
Water networks. The reduction from 183.5 M to 7.3 M
for the MUNIN2 network makes it possible to perform
exact computations using the junction-tree methodol­
ogy. The large savings for the MUNIN2 and the Water
networks are due partly to the fact that a number of
the orphan nodes are instantiated to their 'normal'
state.

DISCUSSION

An important feature of a clique-potential approxi­
mation is the attenuation of its impact with increas­
ing distance from the target clique (Kjcerulff 1993).
This feature is especially important in connection with
time-sliced Bayesian networks. An additional property
of the method, is the property of errors remaining lo­
calized in absence of posterior evidence and, under cer­
tain conditions, even in presence of posterior evidence
(Kjcerulff 1993).
The presented approximation method has been com­
pared with the method suggested by Jensen & Ander­
sen (1990). Briefly, their method is based on anni­
hilation of small probabilities by setting the k small­
est probabilities to zero for each clique potential of a
junction tree, where k is chosen such that the sum
of the k smallest probabilities is less than a predeter­
mined threshold. After annihilation, the belief tables
are compressed in order to take advantage of the in­
troduced zeros.
The comparison (reported in Kjcerulff (1993)) demon­
strates that link removal in some cases is significantly
better than annihilation. In other cases, however, a
comparison turns out to the disadvantage of link re­
moval. Intuitively, this seems absolutely reasonable,
since a model including links representing weak de­
pendences will be almost equivalent to a model which
lacks these links, but it might be quite different from a
model obtained by uniformly removing a correspond­
ing amount of probability mass from the belief tables.
On the other hand, link removal is unsuited in cases
where there are no 'weak links'. Thus, to approxi­
mate a given network using these two methods, link
removal should be tried first and when all 'weak links'
have been removed, annihilation should take over.

Kja!rulff

Application of link removal does not require the con­
struction of exact clique potentials (as opposed to an­
nihilation). Further, the creation of simulated clique
potentials (through e.g. forward sampling) and possi­
ble subsequent link removal provides a way of estab­
lishing an annihilated and compressed junction tree
representation of a network without first creating ex­
act potentials.
Inequality (8) is essential, since the key indicator asso­
ciated with an approximation is most often the max­
imum absolute error. However, under arrival of pos­
terior evidence, the inequality can only be used as a
rough guideline. Thus, among directions for future re­
search, an important one is assessment of a good upper
bound on the error given evidence.
