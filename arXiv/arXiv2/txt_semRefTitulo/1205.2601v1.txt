Theorem 1 has several intuitive and desirable corollaries.
First, the following corollary shows that, for any explanation

x1:k

with belief update ratio greater than or equal to

1.0, adding any independent variable to the explanation will
decrease its GBF score [12].

x1:k be an explanation with r(x1:k ; e) ≥
1.0, and y be a state of a variable Y such that
P (y|x1:k , e) ≤ P (y|x1:k ). Then

Corollary 3. Let

x1:k be an explanation with r(x1:k ; e) ≥
1.0, and y be a state of variable Y independent from variables in x1:k and e. Then

Corollary 1. Let

GBF (x1:k ∪ {y}; e) ≤ GBF (x1:k ; e).

GBF (x1:k ∪ {y}; e) ≤ GBF (x1:k ; e).

(11)

(9)
This is again an intuitive result; a variable state whose posterior probability decreases for given evidence should not
be part of an explanation for the evidence.

Therefore, adding an irrelevant variable dilutes the explanative power of an existing explanation. MRE is able to
automatically prune such variables. This is clearly a desir-

Explaining away

One unique property of Bayesian networks is that they can
model the so called explaining away phenomenon using the

V

structure, i.e., a single variable with two or more parents.

This structure intuitively captures the situation where an
effect has multiple causes. Observing the presence of the
effect and one of the causes reduces the likelihood of the
presence of the other causes. It is desirable to capture this

Corollary 2 is a more general result than corollary 1 and
captures the intuition that conditionally independent variables add no additional information to an explanation in
explaining given evidence, even though the variable may
be marginally dependent on the evidence. Also note that
these properties are all relative to an existing explanation.
It is possible that a variable is independent from the evidence given one explanation, but becomes dependent on
the evidence given another explanation.

In other words,

GBF score is not monotonic. Looking at variables one by
one does not guarantee to nd the optimal solution.
The above results can be further relaxed to accommodate
cases where the posterior probability of

y given e is smaller

phenomenon when generating explanations.
MRE seems able to capture the explaining away effect using CBF. CBF provides a measure on how relevant a new
variable is to an existing explanation.

In an explaining-

away situation, if one of the causes is already present in
the current explanation, other causes typically do not receive high CBF scores.

Again for the running example,

(¬B, ¬C) and (¬A) are both good explanations for the evidence by themselves. The CBF of ¬A given only e (the
effect) is equal to its GBF (39.44), which is rather high.

(¬B, ¬C) (one of the causes) is also obCBF (¬A; e|¬B, ¬C) becomes rather low and is

will obtain these rather similar explanations: (¬B, ¬C),
(A, ¬B, ¬C), and (¬B, ¬C, D), which are rather similar.
Since (A, ¬B, ¬C), (¬B, ¬C, D), and (A, ¬B, ¬C, D)
are strongly dominated by (¬B, ¬C), we should only consider (¬B, ¬C) out of those four explanations. Similarly,

Our experiments compared MRE with MAP given their
similarities. We tested two versions of the MAP algorithm,
one focusing on all the target variables (F-MAP) and the
other only on the target variables selected by MRE (PMAP). In addition, we compared with the Marginal algorithm, which neglects the interdependence among the target variables and uses the marginal posterior probabilities
to determine the most likely states of the target variables.
We plot the accuracy statistics, including precision (the per-

We make the following observations from these results.
First, MRE is able to achieve higher precision and/or recall
rates in identifying the faulty target variables than the other
algorithms on all the networks except Munin. An outstanding example is the SmallHepar network. Marginal, F-MAP
and P-MAP all failed badly on this model in identifying the
faulty variables, while MRE was able to achieve reasonable
performance. It is clearly desirable given that one major
goal of diagnosis or explanation is to identify problems,
e.g.

faulty states.
