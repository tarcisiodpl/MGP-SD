Defining Explanation in Probabilistic Systems

In this paper, we concentrate on two definitions of expla­
nation, one due to Gardenfors (I 988) and the other to Pearl

(1988), as represen tative s of the two approaches mentioned
above . While, as we point out, there are signifi cant prob­
lems with these definitions, we consider them because they
have some important features that we feel should constitute
part of an ap p roach to defining explanation. We suggest an
approach that combines what we feel are the best features
of these two definitions with s ome ideas from the more re­
cent work on causality (Balke and Pearll994; Druzdzel and
Simon 1993; Beckerman and Shachter 1995; Pearl 1 995).

One of the observations that falls naturally out of our ap­
proach is that we should expect different answers depending
on whether we are asking for an explanation of beliefs or
facts . For example, if the agent believes that it rained last
night and we ask for an explanation for this belief, then a
perfe ctly reasonable explanation i s that he or she notic:OO
the wet grass in the morning, which is correlated with rain.
However, if the agent observes that it is raining and we ask
for the best explanation of this observation, then it would
certainly not be sati sfactory to be told that the grass is wet.
We do not accept the wet grass as an expl anation in the
second case because the wet grass is not a cause of rain.
However, we would accept it in the first case because the
agen t believing that the grass is wet is a cause of the agent
believing that it rained. The critical difference between ex­
planations of beliefs and explanations of observations does
not seem to have been discussed before in the literature.
The rest of the p aper is organized as follows. In Sections

2 a nd 3 we present and analyze Gardenfors' and Pearl's

definitions. In Section 4 we present a new ap proach which

generalizes elements of both. We conclude with some open
pr oblems in Section 5.

2.1

GARDENFORS' APPROACH
THE DEFINITION

As we sug gested earlier r oughly speaking for Gardenfors,
X is an explanation of E if Pr(EIX) > Pr(E). That is, X
is an explanati on of E if learning X raises the pr obability
of E. In order to flesh out this intuition, we need to make
precise what probability distribution we are using.
,

,

According to Gardenfors, what requires explanation i s

something that is already known, but was unexpected : A
person asking fo r an explanation expresses a "cognitive dis­
sonance" between the explanandum and the rest of his or
her beliefs. We don t typically require an explanation for
something we expected all along. The amount of disso­
nance is mea sured by the surprise value of the explanan­
dum in the belief state in whi ch we reject our belief in
the explanandum while holding as many as possible of our
other beliefs intact (this operation is called contraction and
c ome s from the belief revision framework (Alchourr6n,
Gardenfors, and Makinson 1985)). An explanation pro­
vides "cognitive relief"; the degree of cognitive relief" is
measured by the degree to which the explanation decreases
the surprise value.
'

63

For example if we ask for an explanation of why David
has the flu, then we already know that David has the flu.
Thus, if E is the statement "David has the flu", then in
the current situation, we already ascribe probability 1 to E.
Nothing that we could learn could increase that probability.
On th e other hand, we pr esumably asked for an explanation
,

because before David got sick, we did not expect him to
get sick. That is, if Pr:E describes the agent s probability
distribution in the contracted belief state, before David got
flu, we expect Pr:E (E) not to be too high. An explanation X
'

(like "David was playing with S ara who also has the flu")
would raise the probability of E in the contracted belief
state, that is, we have
,

PrE;(EIX)

>

PrE;(E).

As Giirdenfors' definition stresses, what counts as an e xp la­
nation de pends on the agent s epistemic state. An explana­
tion for one agent may not be an explanation for another, as
the following example, essentially taken from (Giirdenfors
1988), shows.
'

Example 2.1 If we ask why Mr. Johansson has been taken
ill with lung cancer, the information that he worked in as­

bestos manufacturing for many years is not going to be a
satisfactory explanation if we don't know anything about
the effects of asbestos on people's health. Adding the state­
ment "70% of those who work with asbestos develop lung
cancer" makes the explanation complete. The explana­
tion must consist of both statements. However, if we try
to explain Mr. Johansson's illness to his close friend, who
is likely to know his profession, we would supply only the
second piece of information. Similarly, to someone who
knows more about asbestos but less about Mr Johansson,
we would only present the information about his profession.

To formalize these intuitions, Glirdenfors characterizes a
(p robab ili stic) epistemic state using the possible worlds
model. At any given time, an agent is assumed to con­
sider a number of worlds (or states of the world) possible.
For example, if the agent looks out the window and notices
that it is raining, his set of possible worlds would include
only worlds where it is raining. Learning new facts about
the world furthe r restricts the set of the worlds we con�
sider p ossible Among the possible worlds, some may be
more like l y than the others. To describe this likelihood the
.

,

agent is assumed to have a probability distribution over the
possible worlds.
Thus, an epistemic state is taken to be a pair K (W, Pr},
where W is a set of possible worlds (or possible states of the
world) and Pr is a probability distribution on W. A sentence
A is said to be accepted as knowledge in an epistemic state
K if Pr( A) = 1. We sometimes abuse notation and write
=

A

E

K if A is accepted in epistemic state K.

Given an epistemic state K = (W, Pr} of an agent, let
::::: {WE', Pr:E) denote the contraction of K with re­
spect to E, i.e., the epistemic state characterizing the
agent's beliefs that is as close to K as possible such that
E � KF,. Gardenfors describes a number o f postulates that
K£ should satisfy, such as K"E = Kif Eft K. It is be­
yond the scope of this paper to discuss these postulates (see

Ki:

64

Chajewska and Halpern

(Alchourr6n, Giirdenfors, and Makinson 1985)). However,
these postulates do not serve to specify Ki uniquely; that
is, given K and E, there may be several epistemic states
K' that satisfy the postulates. On the other band, there are
some situations where it is straightforward to specify Ki.
For example, if Pr is determined by a Bayesian network
together with some observations, including E , then Pr£j is
just the distribution that results from the Bayesian network
and all the observations but E.
We can now present Giirdenfors' definition of explanation.
Definition 2.2 (from (Gll.rdenfors

1988)) X is an explana­
tion of E relative to a state of belief K = (W, Pr) (where
E

E

K)if

1. Pr:E(EIX)

>

Pr:g(E), and

2. Pr(X) < 1 (that is, X ¢. K).
We have already seen the first clause of this definition.
Note that, in this clause (and throughout this paper), we
identify the formulas E and X with sets of possible worlds,
namely, the sets of worlds {in W.B') in which E and X,
respectively, are true. The second clause helps enforce
the intuition that the explanation depends on the agent's
epistemic state. The explanation cannot be something the
agent already knows. For example, fire will not be an
explanation of smoke if the agent already knows that there
is a fire. Notice that the second clause also prevents E
from being an explanation for itself. (Clearly E satisfies
the first clause, since Pr:E( EIE) > Pr:E( E); since we have
assumed E E K, E does not satisfy the second clause.)
Unfortunately, as we shall see, while the second clause does
exclude E as an explanation, it does not exclude enough.
Given this notion of explanation, we can define an ordering
on explanations that takes into account the degree to which
an explanation raises the probability of the explanandum.
Gardenfors in fact defined explanatory power as the dif­
ference between the posterior and prior probability of the
explanandum. Thus, a better explanation is one with better
explanatory power.
The difference is not always a good measure of distance
between probabilities. An explanation which raises the
probability of a statement of interest from 0.50000 l to 0.51
is not so powerful . On the other hand, an explanation raising
the probability from 0.000001 to 0.01 would be received
quite differently, although the difference in probabilities is
the same. A more natural way to define explanatory power
is by using the ratio of the two probabilities.
Definition 2.3

The explanatory power (EP) of X with re­

spect to E is
EP(X' E)

=

Pr:E(EIX)
PrE( E)

.

According to this definition, the two explanations above
have dramatically different explanatory power. For this
paper, we take the latter definition as our formal definition
of explanatory power.

Before we get to our critique of Gardenfors' definition,
there is one other issue we need to discuss: the language
in which explanations are given. Definition 2.3 makes per"
feet sense if, for example, explanations are propositional
formulas over a finite set of primitive propositions. In tha�
case, a world w could be taken to be a truth assignment to
a finite family of these primitive propositions. We could
also take explanations to be first-order formulas, in which
case a world could be taken to be a first-order interpretation.
Gllrdenfors in fact allows even richer explanations, involv­
ing statistical statements. As we saw, in Example 2.1, a
possible explanation of Mr. Johansson's illness for someone
who already knew that he worked in asbestos manufactur­
ing is to say "70% of those who work with asbestos develop
lung cancer". To make sense of this, Glirdenfors associates
with a world not only a first-order interpretation, but a distri­
bution over individuals in the domain. (This type of model
is also considered in (Halpern 1990), wbere a structure con­
sists of possible worlds, with a distribution over the worlds,
and, in each world there is a distribution on the individuals
in that world; a formal language is provided for reasoning
about such models. If the domain is finite, we could sim­
plify things and assume that the distribution is the uniform
distribution, as is done in (Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and
Koller 1996).) While it is not necessary to consider such
a rich language to make sense of Glirdenfors' definition,
one of his key insights is that statistical assertions are an
important component of explanations. Indeed, he explicitly
describes an explanation as a conjunction xl 1\ x2. where
X1 is a conjunction of statistical assertions and X2 is what
Glirdenfors calls a singular sentence, by which he means
a Boolean combination of atomic sentences in a first-order
language with only unary predicates. (Either conjunct may
be omitted.) As we shall argue, we need to generalize this
somewhat to allow causal assertions as well as statistical
assertions.

2.2

A

CRITIQUE

While Giirdenfors' definition has some compelling features
(see (Glirdenfors 1988) for further discussion), it also has
some serious problems, both practical and philosophical.
We describe some of them in this section.

1. While the second clause prevents E from being an ex­

planation of itself, there are many other explanations
that it does not block. Let F be any formula such
that Pr(F) < 1 and Pr:g( E 1\ F) > 0. Then E 1\ F
will be an explanation for E. Moreover, it will be
the explanation with the highest possible explanatory
power (both according to G�denfors' original defi­
nition and our modification). This is obvious, since
Pr:g( EI E 1\ F) = 1. Note that F can be practically
any formula here. We surely wouldn't want to accept
" E and the coin lands heads" as an explanation for E.
One possible solution to this problem is to restrict ex­
planations to only involving certain propositions. For
example, if we are looking for an explanation for some
symptoms, we might require that the explanation be a
disease. There are many cases where such restrictions
make sense, but if we are to do this, then we mus�

bilities in that contracted belief state). If an approach
like this is to be used in a system, we need techniques
for computing the contraction. More accurately, since
the contraction is not unique, we need to focus on ap­
plications where there is a relatively straightforward
notion of contraction.

explain where the restrictions are coming from.

2. Even if we restrict attention to a particular vocabulary

for explanations, there is nothing preventing us from
adding irrelevant conjuncts to an explanation. More
precisely, note that if X is an explanation of E, and
C is conditionally independent of E given X, then
PrE:(EJX) = Pri(EJX A C). Thus, X and X A C
are viewed as equally good explanations.

3

4. The fact that learning X raises the probability of E

does not by itself qualify X to be an explanation of
E. For example, suppose s is a symptom of disease
d and Bob knows this. If Bob learns from a doc­
tor that David has disease d and asks the doctor for
an explanation, he certainly would not accept as an
explanation that David has symptoms, even though
Pr;I(djs) > Pr;f(d). Giirdenfors is aware of this is­
sue, and discusses it in some detail {1988, p. 205). He
would call s an explanation of d, but not a causal ex­
planation. Gi!rdenfors provides a definition of causal
explanation. Unfortuna tely, while it deals with this
problem, it does not deal with the other problems we
have raised, so we do not discuss it here.2 We dis­
agree with Gardefnors that there are explanations that
are not causal; we view all explanations as causal. In
particular, we do not think that Bob would accept s
as an explanation of d at all. Note, however, that if
Bob had asked the doctor why he ( the doctor) believed
that David had disease d, an acceptable explanation
would have been that the doctor believed (or knew)
that David had symptoms. There is a big difference
between what Bob would accept as an explanation for
d and what he would accept as an explanation of the
doctor's belief that d. We return to this issue below.

5. As a practical matter, Gardenfors' definition requires

the computation of the contraction of a belief state
(besides the computation of many conditional proba-

arguments show that Giirdenfors' definition of causal explanation
still suffers from all the other problems we have raised.

THE MAXIMUM A POSTERIORI

MODEL APPROACH

3. The definition does not take into account the likeli­

hood of the explanation. For example, suppose there
are two explanations for a symptoms, disease d1 and
d isea se d2, with the same explanatory power, but d1
is a relatively common disease, while d2 is quite rare.
If the explanation is given by an expert that is trusted
by the user (as in the case of an intelligent tutoring
system), then once we are told that, say d2 is the ex­
planation. we would presumably accept it as true. In
this case, the prior probability (i.e., the fact that d2 is
rare) is irrelevant. However, in our context, even if
Pr; (sldt) = Pr; (s\d2), it seems clear that we should
prefer the explanation dt to d2.

3.1

THE DEFINITION

Most of the work done on explanation in belief networks
was based on the intuition that the best explanation for an
observation is the state of the world that is most proba­
ble given the evidence (Henrion and Druzdzel 1990; Pearl
1988; Shimony 1991). There is no notion of "cognitive
dissonance" or surprise. The explanation is an (informed)
guess about the possible world we are currently in, based
on the evidence (which includes the explanandum). In
some cases (e.g., (Pearl l988)), the guess must specify the
world completely-formulas describing sets of worlds are
not allowed as explanations. This approach, which we
call Maximum A Posteriori model {MAP) after (Shimony
1991 ), has been also known under other names: Most Prob­
able Explanation (MPE) (Pearl1988) and Scenario-Based
Explanation (Henrion and Druzdzell990).
Formally, according to Pearl, given an epistemic state
K = (W, Pr}, an explanation for E is simply a world
w in which E is true.
This notion of explanation in­
duces an obvious ordering on explanations. World w1 is
a better explanation of E than w2 if E is true in both w1
and w2 and Pr(wiJE) > Pr(w2jE). Finally, the best or
most probable explanation (MPE) is the world w* such that
Pr(w*jE) = maxwEW Pr(wJE).3
We remark that although we have spoken here of an ex­
planation as being a world, we could equally well take an
explanation to be the formula that characterizes the world
if we assume (as Pearl does) that each world is uniquely
characterized by a formula. If our vocabulary consists of a
finite number of propositions P1, ... , Pit, and each world is
a truth ass1gnment to these primitive propositions, then an
explanation would have the form QII\
A Qk, where each Qi
is either Pi or •Pi· Of course, if we have richer languages,
finding formulas that characterize worlds becomes more of
an issue.
• • •

Two other variants of the MAP approach have been pro­
posed, by Henrion and Druzdzel (1990) and Shimony
(1991, 1993). They share with Pearl's definition two impor­
tant features: Ftrst, the explanation is a truth assigrunent to
3 Actually, Pearl did not define the notion of explanation, just
that of most probable explanation. However, our definitions are
certainly in the spirit of his. Also, he did not talk explicitly of

worlds and epistemic states, but these are implicit in his defini­
tions. Pearl assumes that there is a Bayesian network that de­
scribes a number of variables of interest. The set W then consists
of all possible assignments to the variables, and the probability
distribution Pr on W is determined by the Bayesian network.

66

Chajewska and Halpern

a subset of propositions, including the explanandum. Sec­
ond, the ordering of explanations is based on their posterior
probability given the explanandum.
Henrion and Drozdzel actually discuss a number of ap­
proaches to explanation. Of most relevance here are what
they call scenario-based explanations. They assume a tree
of propositions (a scenario tree), where a path from the
root to a leaf represents a scenario, or a sequence of events.
They are looking for the scenario with the highest probabil­
4
ity given the explanandum. Thus, their approach differs
from Pearl's in that the system has additional knowledge
(the scenarios). They also allow explanations to be partial.
The truth values of all propositions do not have to be spec­
ified. However, explanations are restricted to coming from
a set of prespecified scenarios.
Shimony (1991, 1993) also allows partial explanations.
He works in the framework of Bayesian networks (as
does Pearl, in fact, although his definition makes sense
even if probabilities are not represented using Bayesian
networks).5 In his framework, the explanandum is an in­
stantiation of (truth assignment to) some nodes in the net­
work; these are called the evidence nodes. An explanation
is a truth assignment to the "relevant" nodes in the net­

work. The relevant nodes include the evidence nodes and

only ancestors of evidence nodes can be relevant. Roughly

speaking, an ancestor of a given node is irrelevant if it has
the property that it is independent of that node given the
values of the other ancestors. In (Shimony 1991), the best

explanation is taken to be the one with the highest poste­
rior probability. In (Shimony 1993), this is extended to
allow explanations to be sets of partial truth assignments,

subject to certain constraints

Section 4.3.)
3.2

A

(discussed in more detail in

CRITIQUE

The MAP approach has an advantage over Gardenfors':
it doesn't require contraction. However, it has its own
problems. Some of the problems are particularly acute in
Pearl's approach, with its requirement that the explanation

be complete; i.e., a world; they are alleviated somewhat if

we allow partial explanations (sets of worlds). However,
some of the problems arise in all variants of the approach,
and are a consequence of ordering according to the posterior
probability distribution.
1. By making the explanation a complete world, the no­

tion becomes very sensitive to the choice of language,
as Pearl himself observes. 6 For example, if our lan­
guage consists of {s, d1, d2}, then the best explanation

4 Actually, they suggest presenting all scenarios that have suf­
ficiently high probability, and pointing out how the most probable
one differs from the other likely scenarios.

5Recall that a Bayesian network is an acyclic directed graph
whose nodes represent primitive propositions {or random vari­
ables), together with conditional probability tables describing the
probability of a node given instantiations of its parents (Pearl

1988).
6Shimony (1991) calls this the

overspecification problem.

for symptoms might be d1, or, more precisely, the
world characterized by s A d 1 A ...,d2. For the purposes
of this example, suppose that diseases are mutually
exclusive, so all worlds where the agent has more than
one disease have probability 0. Now suppose we sub­
divide d1 into two diseases d� and d�', again mutually
exclusive (as, for example, hepatitis can be subdivided
into hepatitis A and hepatitis B). Then we might find
d2 to be a better explanation than either d� or d� (that
is, Pr( ·d� A ·d� A d2l s) may be greater than either
Pr(d� A -.d'( A •d2ls) or Pr( ·d� Ad� A •d2ls ))
.

Pearl gives an even sharper example of this phe­

nomenon. Suppose that d1 is a a diagnosis of per­
fect health, d2 is a diagnosis of a fatal disease,
Pr(dtls) = 0.8, and Pr(d2ls) = 0.2. Now suppose we
expand the vocabulary to include h1, . , hs, where the
hi's are possible holidays that the agent will take next
year (provided he or she is indeed healthy), and the
agent considers each of these vacation plans equally
0.1, and the
likely. Then we have that Pr( h; A dtl s)
most likely explanation of the symptom has changed
.

.

=

from d 1 to d2! So just by considering possible holidays
he might take given that he is healthy, the agent finds
that the best explanation for his symptoms becomes a
fatal disease.

2. A

related problem is the fact that if we have a large

number of primitive propositions, most will probably

be irrelevant or only marginally relevant to explaining
a particular proposition. Yet, Pearl's definition forces
us to consider worlds, thus forcing us to worry about
the truth value of all propositions. This can cause
computational problems. In addition, conciseness is a

desirable feature in an explanation, particularly in an
interactive system. The user usually wants to know
only the most influential elements of the complete
explanation, and does not want to be burdened with
unnecessary detail. This problem is particularly se­
vere if we insist on complete explanations. However,
Shimony's partial explanations are not necessarily as
concise as one would hope either. It is not hard to show
that for each evidence node X, the explanation must
include an assignment to all the nodes in at least one
path from X to the root, since for each relevant node,
at least one of its parents must be relevant Moreover,
the irrelevance condition is quite strong and only in
limited contexts is it likely to achieve significant prun­
ing. Shimony attempts to overcome this problem by
relaxing the irrelevance assumption to what he calls
approximate or 8-irrelevance. While helpful in some
domains, the extent to which it will result in concise
explanations in general is not clear. We discuss this
point in more detail in the full paper.

3. The ordering on explanations used in the MAP ap­
proach is supposed to maximize the probability of
the explanation given the explanandum. However,

if we consider only explanations which include the
explanandum (as all MAP explanations do), this re­
duces to maximizing the prior of the explanation. The
ordering is then based only on the likelihood of the ex­
planation and not in any way on the degree to which the

Defining Explanation in Probabil istic Systems

explanation raises the probability of the explanandum.

4. All the MAP approaches discussed above consider es­
sentially propositional languages. Once we move to
richer languages (like first-order, or languages that al­
low statistical information), then each world may end
up having very low probability. Indeed, if we have a
continuous number of worlds, each world may have
probability 0. In this case, the definition which re­
quires explanations to be complete worlds is not even
useful.
Given the difficulties with complete explanations, why do
Shimony and Henrion and Druzdzel put such restrictions
on the allowable partial explanations? What is the prob­
lem with partial explanations? Suppose our language con­
sists of the propositions {Pl, ... , pk}. Why not just allow
Pl as an explanation, instead of requiring something like
Pl A ...,P2 1\

... A

-.pit? Gardenfors certainly allows such
explanations. It is not bard to see why Pearl does not allow
partial explanations. Notice that a partial explanation is
really a set of worlds (or equivalently, the disjunction of the
formulas representing the worlds). But a disjunction will
always have higher conditional probability than any of its
disjuncts (except in the degenerate case where all but one
of the disjuncts has probability 0), and thus will be viewed
as a more probable explanation than any of its disjuncts.
It is because of this that Shimony puts restrictions on the
allowable partial explanations as well. As we shall see,
we can deal with this problem, at least to some extent, by
modifying the ordering of explanations.

SYNTHESIS

As we have seen, both Gardenfors' definition and the MAP
definition have problems. We believe that in order to deal
with these problems, we need to deal with two relatively
orthogonal issues: (1) we must decide what counts as an
explanation, and (2) we must decide how to compare two
explanations.

4.1

WHAT COUNTS AS AN EXPLANATION?

The MAP approach seems somewhat too restrictive in what
counts as an explanation: An explanation must be a com­
plete description of a world (or a restricted form of partial
explanation). Gardenfors, on the other hand, is not restric­
tive enough. He allows E A C to be an explanation of
E, for example, and this seems to us unreasonable. In ad­
dition, he would allow a falling barometer reading to be
an explanation for a storm, thus missing out on the causal
structure.
As we mentioned above, we view all explanations as causal.
We distinguish between explaining facts and explaining be­
liefs, but in both cases we look for the same thing in an
explanation: a causal mechanism which (possibly together
with some facts) is responsible for the fact observed or
the beliefs adopted. By enforcing causality, AGMwe be­
lieve that we can avoid the problems in G!rdenfors' defini­
tion, while still allowing more general explanations than the

67

MAP approach would allow. We remark that we are not the
first to stress the role of causality in explanation. Salmon
(I 984) discusses the issue at length, although the technical
details of his proposal are quite different from ours.
The literature on causality is at l east as large as the literature
on explanation; it is well beyond the scope of this paper to
develop a new theory of causality. For the purposes of the
rest of this paper, we work at the propositional level (since
that is essentially what the recent approaches to causality
do) and assume that the causal mechanism is described by
a causal structure, which we take to be a Bayesian network
interpreted causally.

We believe that much of what we do is independent of the
particular way we choose to model causality. In particular,
we can replace the causal network by structural equations,
as described in (Druzdzel and Simon 1993; Pearl1995). We
have chosen to use Bayesian networks as our representation
for causality simply to make it easier to relate our approach
to Pearl's approach.
In this setting, part of the agent's uncertainty concerns what
the right causal mechanism is. For example, an agent may
be uncertain whether smoking causes cancer or whether
there is a gene that causes both a susceptibility to cancer
and a susceptibility to smoking. Thus, we assume that a

world is a pair ( w, C) consisting of a truth assignment w
and a causal structure C. As before, an epistemic state
K is a pair (W, Pr), where W is a set of worlds of this
form, and Pr is a probability distribution on W. However,
we assume that this epistemic state arises from a simpler

description: We assume that the agent has a probability
distribution Pr' o n causal structures and has made some
observations. Notice that a causal structure

C

also places

a probability distribution Pre on worlds. We require that

the distribution Pr be consistent with the causal mechanisms

considered possible and the observations 0 in the following

sense: There must be a probability distribution IY on causal
mechanisms such that Pr(w, C) = Pr'(C) Prc(wiO): that
is, the probability of (w, C) is the probability of the causal
mechanism C times the probability that C induces on w,
given the observation. In particular, this means that if the
agent considers only one causal mechanism possible, we
can identify Pr with a probability on truth assignments, just
as Pearl does.

We assume that the explanandum E is one of the ob­

is a conjunction

X1 (that is, a description of a causal structure; see below)
and an instantiation of nodes X2 that causally precede E
in Xt such that Pr(X) < l. (Yt/e defer for now the is­
sue of whether the explanation raises the probability of the
explanandum.)
We are deliberately being vague about the language used to
describe the causal mechanism, since we believe that this is

an area for further research. For the purposes of this paper,

68

Chajewska and Halpern

we can take Xt to be simply a description of a subgraph of
the causal graph (intuitively, that part of the causal graph
that is relevant to explaining E, i.e., a subset of the set of
paths from nodes in X2 to E).
We allow the conjunct describing the causal mechanism to
be missing from the explanation if it is known. (In practice,
this might mean that the system providing the explanation
believes that the agent to whom the explanation is being pro­
vided knows the causal mechanism.) Notice that if the agent
knows the causal mechanism, and thus considers only one
causal mechanism possible (as is implicitly the case when a
situation is described by a Bayesian network which is given
a causal interpretation), then a world can be identified with
a truth assignment. In this case (ignoring the requirement
that all the conjuncts in a basic explanation of E must pre­
cede E causally), what Pearl called an explanation would
be a special case of what we are calling an explanation.
However, we allow more general explanations, in that we
do not require an explanation to be a truth assignment. In
this sense, our framework can be viewed as generalizing
Pearl's and S bimony's.

Our definition also borrows heavily from Glirdenfors' defi­
nition. We take from him the requirement that Pr( X) < 1.

His other requirement, that Pre(E I X ) > Pre (E), will also
play a role in our ordering of explanations. The form of
the explanation-a conjunction of a (partial) causal mech­
anism and an instantiations of nodes-is also taken from
G!irdenfors.7 Since we are working with propositional
Bayesian networks, the instantiation of nodes clearly corre­
sponds to taking the conjunction of atomic sentences in first­
order logic. Giirdenfors allows disjunctions as well (since
he allows singular sentences, which are Boolean combina­
tions of atomic sentences). Allowing disjunctions seems to
cause problems for us; we return to this issue in Section 4.3.
The (partial) causal mechanism can be viewed as a gener­
alization of statistical assertions. We view the requirement
of the causal mechanism as a key difference between our
definition and Giirdenfors'. For one thing, the causality
requirement prevents E 1\ C from being an explanation of
E, since E cannot precede E in the causal ordering. It also
prevents a symptom from being an explanation of a disease.
We would argue that causality is what makes most of
Gardenfors examples involving statistics so compelling.
For example, consider the case of Mr. Johansson. We be­
lieve that the explanation "70% of those who work with
asbestos develop lung cancer" involves more than just the
statistical assertion. It is accepted as an explanation because
we implicitly accept that there is a causal structure with an
edge from a node labeled asbestos to a node labeled lung
cancer (with a conditional probability table saying that the
probability of lung cancer given asbestos is 0.7). And it is
the lack of causality that causes us (if the reader will pardon
the pun) not to accept "70% of the time that the barometer
reading goes down there is a storm" as an explanation of a
storm (unless we happen to believe that barometer readings
have a causal influence on storms).
7 Originally,

the idea carne from Hempel's work on explanation

(Hempel and Oppenheim 1948).

However, the situation is different if we try to explain our
beliefs to someone else. In this case, the causal structure is
symmetric. The fact that I believe that there is a storm does
explain my belief that the barometer reading has gone down;
my belief that the barometer reading has gone down is an
explanation for my belief that there is a storm. Ultimately,
these beliefs should be rooted in an observation (either of
the storm or the barometer).
We can readily convert a causal network describing a sit­
uation to a network describing an agent's beliefs. We just
reinterpret all the nodes so that a node labeled X talks about
the agent's belief in X ,moralize the graph and change all the
directed edges to undirected edges. The resulting Markov
network (Pearl 1 988) captures the causal as well as proba­
bilistic dependencies between the agent's beliefs. Note that
the resulting network is no longer asymmetric. While we
do not view a symptom as a cause for a disease, believing
that a patient has a certain symptom might well cause us to
believe that he has a disease. However, an explanation for
the agent's beliefs would then be an acyclic subnetwork of
this network, together with some new nodes representing
the external causes of some of the beliefs. For example, an
external cause for the belief that the patient has symptom d
is the observation of the symptom; an external cause for the
belief that David has an ear infection might be receiving
that information from a doctor. We discuss this in more
detail in the full paper.

4.2

ORDERING EXPLANATIONS

As we have seen in the few examples presented so far, and
as is indeed the case in many applications, there are typi­
cally several competing explanations. We need to be able to
compare them and choose the best. The two proposals pre­
sented above for ordering explanations-Giirdenfors' no­
tion of explanatory power and Pearl's notion of considering
the probability of the explanation given the explanandum­
both have their merits, but neither seems quite right to us.
The following example might help clarify the differences
between them.

Example 4.1 Assume that we have a bag of 100 coins, 99
of which are strongly biased (9:1) towards heads and one
that is just as strongly biased towards tails. We pick a coin
at random and toss it. The coin lands tails.

We can nwdel this situation by using two random variables:
C (the type ofcoin) with values bh and bt (biased towards
heads and biased towards tails) and R (the result of the
toss), with values h and t. A priori, the probability that we
picked a coin that is biased towards heads is very high; in
fact P(C == bh) 0.99. After receiving the evidence of the
coin landing tails, wefind out that P(C == bhiR=t) is close
to 0.92-less that the prior on C = bh but still very high.
What explanation would we acceptfor thefact that the coin
landed tails? Clearly, the causal structure in this situation
is known: there is a causal relation between C and R, with
the obvious conditional probability table described by the
story. Since the causal structure is known, the allowable

respect to E and the prior of X . We can then place a partial
order t E on explanations of E by taking X 1 t E X2 iff

greater than Pr( C = bti R = t).8 This explanation, although

as a natural generalization of Pearl's ordering. Suppose the

very likely itself, doesn't seem to relieve the "cognitive

dissonance" between the explanandum and the rest of our
beliefs. While it may be the correct diagnosis of the situa­
tion, it doesn't seem right to call it an explanation. The fact
that the potential explanation is less probable a posteriori
than a priori should at least cause some suspicion.

Pr(���:Jbh) is what we called the explanatory

to which C
bh is an explanation of R = t according to
Pearl is precisely the product of EP( C = bh, R= t) and the
prior probability of C = bh. Thus, we can see the precise
sense in which Pearl's definition takes into account the prior
whereas Gardenfors' does not.

Although the two definitions disagree in this example, there
are many situations of interest in which they agree (which is,
perhaps, why both have seemed to be acceptable definitions
of the notion of explanation) . In particular, they agree in
situations where the prior probability of all explanations
is the same (or almost the same). Thus, if the user has
no particular predisposition to accept one explanation over
another, both approaches will view the same explanation as
most favorable.9"
Since we cannot always count on the prior of all explana­
tions being equal, we would like an ordering on explana­
tions that takes into account both the explanatory power
and the prior. One obvious way of taking both into ac­
count is to multiply them, which is essentially what Pearl
does, but multiplication loses significant information and
sometimes gets counterintuitive results. (More examples
of this appear below.) A straightforward alternative is to
associate with each explanation X of E the pair of numbers

and

C = bt, are incomparable.

This

the prior is the more significant feature here. In a case like
this, such a wide divergence between the explanatory power
and the prior of two explanations might signal a problem
with the causal model. Perhaps the agent's prior on C = bh
vs. C = bt is incorrect in this case.

causal mechanism is known, as is implicitly assumed by

Pearl. If we allow explanations that are complete descrip­

tions of worlds, then all complete descriptions that include
E have exactly the same explanatory power: 1 / Pr:E ( E ) .
Thus, our ordering would order them by their prior, just a s
Pearl's and Shimony's does.

Our ordering also avoids the problem in Gardenfors' or­

Note that, according to Pearl's definition, C = bh would not
be an explanation of R = t. The two possible explanations would

be C = bh i\ R == t and C = bt l\ R = t. What we are analyzing here
is the ordering produced by Pearl's definition of better explanation
on the notion of explanation defined according to our approach.

Here we are also implicitly assuming that there is a prior

served, the two approaches differ in this respect too.

dering that adding irrelevant conjuncts results in an equally
preferred explanation. For example, if X is an explanation
of E then X 1\ Y (for all Y conditionally independent of
E given the epistemic state) would be considered a worse
explanation than X in our ordering since their explanatory
powers are the same and X 's prior is higher.

If we add a conjunct that is not completely irrelevant, then
our approach forces the agent to decide between more spe­
cific explanations that have higher explanatory power, and
less specific explanations, that have a higher prior. For
example, suppose we want to understand why a somewhat
sheltered part of the lawn is wet. One possible explanation
is that it rained last night, but rain does not always cause
that part of the lawn to get wet. A better explanation might
be that it was raining and very windy. The combination of
rain and wind has better explanatory power than rain alone,
but a lower prior. According to our ordering, this makes
the two explanations incomparable. This does not seem
so unreasonable in this case. We would expect a useful
explanatory system to point out both possible explanations,
and let the user decide if the gain from the extra explanatory
power of wind is sufficiently high to merit the lower prior.

Note that if we multiply the explanatory power of the ex­
planation by its prior, we will always prefer the expla­
nation "rain". To see this, note that for any explanation

X, the product of the explanatory power and the prior is
Pr:E (X JE) . Since clearly Pr:E ( X J E) � Pr:E(X A Y I E),
the simpler explanation i s preferred. This is a case where
multiplication causes a loss of useful information.

4.3

DEALING WlTH DISJUNCTIONS

As we have defined it, an explanation is a conjunction of
a partial causal mechanism together with an instantiation
of nodes. We have not allowed disjunctions. Disallow­
ing disjunctions of causal mechanisms seems reasonable.
It is consistent with the intuition that "you have cancer
either because you smoke or because you have a genetic

70

Chajewska and Halpern

predisposition to cancer" is viewed as a disjunction of two
explanations, not one explanation which has the form of a
disjunction. We suspect that it is for similar reasons that
Gardenfors disallowed the disjunction of statistical asser­
tions in his definition.

On the swface, it may seem less reasonable to disallow

the disjunction of instantiations of nodes. Certainly it is
straightforward to modify our definition so as to allow them,
and doing so would be more in keeping with Glirdenfors'

allowing singular sentences. However, notice that allowing
the disjunction of instantiations bas the effect of allowing
disjunctions of causal mechanisms.

Consider a case in which we ask for an explanation of huge
forest fires recently occurring in California. One possible
explanation is that the fire prevention caused the brush to
overgrow, another that the tourists often leave campfires

unattended. Both these explanations are very plausible (and
so is their conjunction). Suppose the agent considers only
one causal network possible, and it contains both of these

mechanisms. Thus, by allowing the explanation "either
some tourists left their campfire unattended or the brush
was overgrown", we are effectively allowing a disjunction
of causal mechanisms. This example suggests that we may
want to make a distinction between what appear to be two
different causal mechanisms co-existing within the same
causal structure (perhaps using the techniques discussed by
Druzdzel and Simon (1 993)). This is an area for future
research.

On the other hand, there

are cases where allowing disjunc­

tions seems useful. For example, consider a situation in
which we have four coins, Ct , C2, C3 , and C4 , where Ct

and c2 . are biased towards heads and c3 and c4 are bi­
ased toward tails. We pick one coin at random and toss

it three times. The coin lands heads every time. The ob­

vious explanation for this fact is that we picked one of
the coins biased towards heads, that is, either cl or c2 .

And, indeed, our ordering would prefer the explanation
X1 =det ( C = CJ ) v ( C = C2) to either of the explanations
C = C1 or C
same bias.

and C2 had the

way for deciding when to add such variables.
Shimony's work can be viewed as an attempt to provide

principles as to when to consider disjunctive explanations.
The partial explanations of (Shimony 1 991) are sets of
worlds where the truth values of some primitive propo­

sitions are fixed, whi le the rest can be arbitrary. The sets of

partial explanations of (Shimony 1 993) correspond to more
general sets of worlds, but there are still significant restric­
tions. For example, the disjunctive explanation must corre­
spond to a node already in the network and the probability
of the explanandum must be the same for every disjunct in
the disjunctive explanation. The latter restriction is quite
severe. In our coin example, if the coins biased towards
heads have different biases, Shimony's approach would not
allow us to consider the explanation xl ' "we picked a coin
biased towards heads". Of course, we can easily loosen
this restriction to allow disjunctions where the conditional
probabilities are almost the same. However, it seems to us
that we want more than just similar conditional probabili­
ties here. We only want to allow disjunctions if the causal
mechanism for each disjunct is the same.

To be fair, Shimony uses his restrictions to allow him to find
good explanations algorithmically. It is not clear whether
there are also philosophical reasons to restrict them in this
way. We hope to explore both the algorithmic and founda­
tional issues in future work.

CONCLUSIONS

We feel that the contribution of this paper is twofold: First,
we present a critique of two important approaches to ex­
planation; second, we outline a sketch of a novel approach
that tries to take into account the best features of both, and
combine them with a notion of causality.

Our approach clearly needs to be fieshed out. S ome areas
for future research include:
•

By way of contrast, the explanation X2 =dcf (C = Ct ) V
( C = C2 ) v ( C = C3 ) does not seem at all reasonable
although, according to our ordering, it is incomparable to

higher prior. While most people would clearly reject X2 ,
it would be useful to have to have some automatic way of
rejecting it.10

This example suggests that rather than allowing disjunc­
tions, a better strategy might be to add an additional variable
representing the type of the coin (with possible values bh
and bt, as before). However, we have as yet no principled

for reasoning about causality, that allowed first-order
reasoning and temporal constructs.

is is another case where multiplyin g the components gives a
misleading answer: Xz has a higher product than X1 . In general,
if we compare the explanation X to a disjunctive explanation
X V Y by multiplying the explanatory power times the prior, then
we will always prefer X V Y to X , for the same reasons as given
earlier for preferring X to X 1\ Y.

Obviously, much of the effort will involve research in
causality. Most of the work in causality has allowed
only what amounts to propositional reasoning. (The
nodes represent random variables that take on a small
finite number of values.) Can we extend it to allow
causal explanations that involve first-order constructs
and temporal constructs? There has been some work
on adding these constructs to Bayesian networks (see,
for example, (Dean and Kanazawa 1 989; Glesner and
Koller 1995; Haddawy 1 994)). but no work focusing

As we have observed, our approach, which provides
only a partial ordering on explanations, seems too

weak. While it is not clear that we want to have a
total order, it does seem that we want to allow more
explanations to be comparable than is the case accord­
ing to our ordering. This is particularly the case if we
allow disjunctive explanations.

Defining Explanation in Probabilistic Systems

•

•

A natural extension would be to apply our definition
to countetfactuals.
After all, humans seem to have no problem with ex­
plaining hypothetical facts. We believe that our basic
framework should be able to handle this, although per­
haps we may need to use structural equations and the
interpretation of countetfactuals given by Balke and
Pearl ( 1 994).
As we said earlier, given that our goal is to have the
system provide an explanation that is useful to a user,
it would be important to model the user's knowledge
state and adjust explanations accordingly. The work of
Suermondt (1 992) is relevant in this regard. He also
puts the emphasis on explaining beliefs (or, specifi­
cally, probability distribution over the node of inter­
est) adopted by the system as a result of receiving some
observation. His goal is to find a small subset of ev­
idence responsible for this change and the links most
influential in transmitting it. In our context, we can
understand Suermondt as considering a system which
has full knowledge of the domain (characterized by a
Bayes Net together with all the conditional probability
tables) and knows the values of some variables, trying
to explain its beliefs to a user with no (or minimal)
knowledge. Thus, for him, an explanation amounts to
finding a "small" set of instantiations of variables (i.e.,
a partial truth assignment) and a ' small" partial causal
mechanism that will raise the posterior probability of
the observations.

Given the importance of explanation, we believe that these
questions represent fruitful lines for further research.
