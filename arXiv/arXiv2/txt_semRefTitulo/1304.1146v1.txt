then ¢>A= P(A!pa(A)) maps Sp(pa(A)U{A}) into
the unit interval [0, 1]. It is convenient to consider
functions which are not normalized and take arbi­
trary non-negative values. So in the sequel, <P and
1/J denote such functions.
Evidence can by entered to a CPN in the form
of findings. Usually a finding is a statement, that
a certain variable is in a particular state.
After evidence has been entered to the CPN one
should update the probabilities for the variables in
the CPN. It would be preferable to have a local
method sending messages to neighbours in the net­
work. However, such methods do not exist when
there are multiple paths in the network.
The HUGIN approach which is an extension of
the work of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter ( 1988)
(Jensen et al 1990a; Jensen et al 1990b) repre­
sents one way of achieving a local propagation
method also for CPN's with multiple paths. This
is done by constructing a so-called junction tree
which represents the same joint probability distri­
bution as the CPN.
The nodes in a junction tree are sets of variables
rather than single variables. Each node V has a
belief table <Pv : Sp(V) - Ro attached to it. The
pair ( V, <Pv) is called a belief universe.
The crucial property of junction trees is that
for any pair ( U, V) of nodes, all nodes on the path
between U and V contain U n V.
A belief table is a (non-normalized) assessment
of joint probabilities for a node. If S C V, then an
(non-normalized) assessment of joint probabilities
for Sp(S) can be obtained from <Pv by marginal­
ization: <Ps = E V\S <Pv
Evidence can be transmitted between belief uni­
verses through the absorption operation: ( U, <Pu)
absorbs from (V, <Pv ) , ... , (W, <Pw) by modifying
<Pu with the functions L: V\S <Pv, . .. , LW\U <Pw.
Actually, the new belief function <Pu is defined as
•

<Pu =

<P'u *

:Evw <Pv

LU\V </>u

*

w
. .. * E ww <P
LU\w <Pu

where the product ¢> * 1/J is defined as
(¢> * 1/J)(x)= ¢>(x),P(x)

Based on the local operation of absorption the two
propagation operations CollectEvidence and Dis­
tributeEvidence are constructed. When CollectEv­
idence in Vis called (from a neighbour W) then V
calls CollectEvidence in all its neighbours (except
W), and when they have finished their CollectEv­
idence, V absorbs from them (see figure 1).

When DistributeEvidence is called in V from a

Having constructed a junction tree, we need not
be as restrictive with findings as in the case of
CPN's:

Sp(V)- {0, 1}

So, a finding is a statement that some configu­
rations of Sp(V) are impossible. Note that the
product of two findings f : Sp(V) - {0, 1} and
9 : Sp(W) - {0, 1} is a finding f * 9 : Sp(V U
W) - { 0, 1}, and f* 9 corresponds to the conjun­
cion f 1\ g.
Using the HUGIN approach, it is possible to en­
ter findings to the CPN (or the junction tree)1,
update the probabilities for all variables, and to

This is done by introducing 'other'-states and
'other'-variables. In the example of Mr. Holmes'
alarm system, an 'other'-variable covering lighten­
ing, flood, baseballs breaking windows etc. could
be introduced to represent unknown causes for the
alarm to go off, and the Burglar variable could
have an 'other'-state covering Mr. Holmes' mis­
tress having forgotten the code for switching off
the burglary alarm.
Though this approach is claimed to be fairly
successful, it raises several problems. First of all
there is a modelling problem. The effect of an
'other'-statement is hard to model without know­
ing what 'other' actually stands for . What should
the conditional probabilities be? In fact, these

should expect:
P(x * ···* y)

>

P(x)

Hence we define the conflict measure conf as:

conf(x, ···,y) =log

P(x) X··· XP(y)
P( X*. * y)
•

.

(where log is with base 2).
This means that a positive conf(x, · ··,y) is an in­
dicator of a possible conflict.
For the data in section 3 we have conf(a, s ) =
4.5.
Using theorem 2, conf(x, · ··,y) is very easy
to calculate in HUGIN. The prior probabilities
P(x),···,P(y) are available before the findings
are entered, and P(x,· ··,y) is the ratio between
the prior and the posterior normalizing constant
for any belief universe.

I

P(x. y,

z. u.

consists of two sets of findings, namely {x,y,z}
and { u,v}. Since the product of findings is also a
finding, we can say that the two findings x * y * z
and u * v meet in V.
The conflict in the data meeting in V is therefore
composed of the conflict between x*y*z and u*v
, the conflict inside {x,y,z} and inside {u,v}. It
is easy to show that:
conf(x, y,z,u,v) =conf(x * y * z, u *z)
+conf(x, y,z) + conf(u,v)
Furthermore, as indicated at figure 4, P( x *y * z)
and P(u * v) can be calculated as ratios between
prior and posterior normalizing constants, and
therefore conf(x,y,z) and conf(u,v) as well as
conf(x * y * z, u * z) are easy to calculate.
In general: If evidence is propagated to any belief
universe U from neighbours V, ···, W originating
from findings (v, .. ·v') . . . ( w,·· ·, w') respectively,
then

conf(v,· · ·,v',··· , W , ··· W 1) =

I

conf(v * ···* v',· ·, w * · · ·* w')
·

+conf(v,···, v') + · ·· + conf( w, ···, w')
All terms are in HUGIN easy to calculate by use
of Theorem 2.
We call conf(v,· ··, v',···, w, ·· ·, w') the global
conflict and conf(v * ·· ·* v',· ··, w * · · ·* w') the
local conflict.
The calculation of conf has been implemented
in HUGIN to follow the calls of CollectEvidence.
The overhead to the propagation methods m
terms of time and space is neglectable.

Example: APB-MUNIN

The conflict measure has been tested on small
fictions examples and on a large subnetwork of
MUNIN, namely the network for the muscle Ab­
ductor Pollicis Brevis (APB). The network is
shown in figure 5.
The rightmost variables in figure 5 are finding
variables. This means that evidence is entered at
the right hand side of the CPN and propagates to
the left. However, as described in section 2, the
propagation takes place in a junction tree of belief
universes. In the test, CollectEvidence was called

Conflict or rare case?

It can happen that typical data from a very rare
case might cause a high value of conf. In the case
of Mr. Holmes' alarm system a flood (with proba­

the data (see figure 10).
