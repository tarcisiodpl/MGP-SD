We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large number
of classes (k), with the goal of obtaining train and test time complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree construction approaches
for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the theoretical front, we formulate a
new objective function, which is optimized at each node of the tree and creates
dynamic partitions of the data which are both pure (in terms of class labels) and
balanced. We demonstrate that under favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves with low label entropy. However, the objective
function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the
empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that this online algorithm quickly achieves improvement in
test error compared to more common logarithmic training time approaches, which
makes it a plausible method in computationally constrained large-k applications.

Introduction

The central problem of this paper is computational complexity in a setting where the number of
classes k for multiclass prediction is very large. Such problems occur in natural language (Which
translation is best?), search (What result is best?), and detection (Who is that?) tasks. Almost all
machine learning algorithms (with the exception of decision trees) have running times for multiclass
classification which are O(k) with a canonical example being one-against-all classifiers [1].
In this setting, the most efficient possible accurate approach is given by information theory [2].
In essence, any multiclass classification algorithm must uniquely specify the bits of all labels that
it predicts correctly on. Consequently, Kraft’s inequality ([2] equation 5.6) implies that the expected computational complexity of predicting correctly is Ω(H(Y )) per example where H(Y ) is
the Shannon entropy of the label. For the worst case distribution on k classes, this implies Ω(log(k))
computation is required.
Hence, our goal is achieving O(log(k)) computational time per example1 for both training and
testing, while effectively using online learning algorithms to minimize passes over the data.
The goal of logarithmic (in k) complexity naturally motivates approaches that construct a logarithmic depth hierarchy over the labels, with one label per leaf. While this hierarchy is sometimes
available through prior knowledge, in many scenarios it needs to be learned as well. This naturally
leads to a partition problem which arises at each node in the hierarchy. The partition problem is
finding a classifier: c : X → {−1, 1} which divides examples into two subsets with a purer set of
labels than the original set. Definitions of purity vary, but canonical examples are the number of
labels remaining in each subset, or softer notions such as the average Shannon entropy of the class
labels. Despite resulting in a classifier, this problem is fundamentally different from standard binary
classification. To see this, note that replacing c(x) with −c(x) is very bad for binary classification,
but has no impact on the quality of a partition2 . The partition problem is fundamentally non-convex

Throughout the paper by logarithmic time we mean logarithmic time per example.
The problem bears parallels to clustering in this regard.

of c(x) and −c(x) is a poor partition (the always-0

function places all points on the same side).
The choice of partition matters in problem dependent ways. For example, consider examples on a
line with label i at position i and threshold classifiers. In this case, trying to partition class labels
{1, 3} from class label 2 results in poor performance.

accuracy

The partition problem is typically solved for decision tree learning via an enumerate-and-test approach amongst a small set of possible classifiers (see e.g. [3]). In the multiclass setting, it is
desirable to achieve substantial error reduction for each node in the tree which motivates using a richer set of classifiers in the nodes to minimize the number of nodes, and thereby decrease the computational complexity. The main theoretical contribution of this work is to establish a boosting algorithm for learning trees with O(k) nodes and O(log k) depth, thereby addressing the goal of logarithmic time train and test complexity. Our main theoretical result,
presented in Section 2.3, generalizes a binary boosting-by-decision-tree theorem [4] to multiclass boosting. As in all boosting results, performance is critically dependent on the quality
of the weak learner, supporting intuition that we need sufficiently rich partitioners at nodes.
The approach uses a new objective for decision tree learning, which we optimize at each
node of the tree. The objective and its theoretical properties are presented in Section 2.

proach? The precise objective studied in theory
fails this test due to its discrete nature, and even natural approximations are challenging to tractably
optimize under computational constraints. As a result, we use the theoretical objective as a motivation and construct a new Logarithmic Online Multiclass Tree (LOMtree) algorithm for empirical
evaluation.

Creating a tree in an online fashion creates a new class of problems. What if some node is initially
created but eventually proves useless because no examples go to it? At best this results in a wasteful
solution, while in practice it starves other parts of the tree which need representational complexity.
To deal with this, we design an efficient process for recycling orphan nodes into locations where
they are needed, and prove that the number of times a node is recycled is at most logarithmic in the
number of examples. The algorithm is described in Section 3 and analyzed in Section 3.1.
And is it effective? Given the inherent non-convexity of the partition problem this is unavoidably
an empirical question which we answer on a range of datasets varying from 26 to 105K classes in
Section 4. We find that under constrained training times, this approach is quite effective compared
to all baselines while dominating other O(log k) train time approaches.
What’s new? To the best of our knowledge, the splitting criterion, the boosting statement, the
LOMtree algorithm, the swapping guarantee, and the experimental results are all new here.

Prior Work

Only a few authors address logarithmic time training. The Filter tree [5] addresses consistent (and
robust) multiclass classification, showing that it is possible in the statistical limit. The Filter tree
does not address the partition problem as we do here which as shown in our experimental section is
often helpful. The partition finding problem is addressed in the conditional probability tree [6], but
that paper addresses conditional probability estimation. Conditional probability estimation can be
converted into multiclass prediction [7], but doing so is not a logarithmic time operation.
Quite a few authors have addressed logarithmic testing time while allowing training time to be O(k)
or worse. While these approaches are intractable on our larger scale problems, we describe them
here for context. The partition problem can be addressed by recursively applying spectral clustering
on a confusion graph [8] (other clustering approaches include [9]). Empirically, this approach has
been found to sometimes lead to badly imbalanced splits [10]. In the context of ranking, another
approach uses k-means hierarchical clustering to recover the label sets for a given partition [11].
The more recent work [12] on the multiclass classification problem addresses it via sparse output
coding by tuning high-cardinality multiclass categorization into a bit-by-bit decoding problem. The
authors decouple the learning processes of coding matrix and bit predictors and use probabilistic
decoding to decode the optimal class label. The authors however specify a class similarity which is
O(k 2 ) to compute (see Section 2.1.1 in [12]), and hence this approach is in a different complexity
class than ours (this is also born out experimentally). The variant of the popular error correcting
output code scheme for solving multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the
assumption of output sparsity was also considered in [13]. Their approach in general requires O(k)
running time to decode since, in essence, the fit of each label to the predictions must be checked
and there are O(k) labels. Another approach [14] proposes iterative least-squares-style algorithms
for multi-class (and multi-label) prediction with relatively large number of examples and data dimensions, and the work of [15] focusing in particular on the cost-sensitive multiclass classification.
Both approaches however have O(k) training time.
Decision trees are naturally structured to allow logarithmic time prediction. Traditional decision
trees often have difficulties with a large number of classes because their splitting criteria are not
well-suited to the large class setting. However, newer approaches [16, 17] have addressed this effectively at significant scales in the context of multilabel classification (multilabel learning, with
missing labels, is also addressed in [18]). More specifically, the first work [16] performs brute force
optimization of a multilabel variant of the Gini index defined over the set of positive labels in the
node and assumes label independence during random forest construction. Their method makes fast
predictions, however has high training costs [17]. The second work [17] optimizes a rank sensitive
loss function (Discounted Cumulative Gain). Additionally, a well-known problem with hierarchical
classification is that the performance significantly deteriorates lower in the hierarchy [19] which
some authors solve by biasing the training distribution to reduce error propagation while simultaneously combining bottom-up and top-down approaches during training [20].
The reduction approach we use for optimizing partitions implicitly optimizes a differential objective.
A non-reductive approach to this has been tried previously [21] on other objectives yielding good
results in a different context.

2

Framework and theoretical analysis

In this section we describe the essential elements of the approach, and outline the theoretical properties of the resulting framework. We begin with high-level ideas.
2.1

Setting

We employ a hierarchical approach for learning a multiclass decision tree structure, training this
structure in a top-down fashion. We assume that we receive examples x ∈ X ⊆ Rd , with labels
y ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. We also assume access to a hypothesis class H where each h ∈ H is a binary
classifier, h : X 7→ {−1, 1}. The overall objective is to learn a tree of depth O(log k), where
each node in the tree consists of a classifier from H. The classifiers are trained in such a way that
hn (x) = 1 (hn denotes the classifier in node n of the tree3 ) means that the example x is sent to the
right subtree of node n, while hn (x) = −1 sends x to the left subtree. When we reach a leaf, we
predict according to the label with the highest frequency amongst the examples reaching that leaf.
3
Further in the paper we skip index n whenever it is clear from the context that we consider a fixed tree
node.

3

In the interest of computational complexity, we want to encourage the number of examples going
to the left and right to be fairly balanced. For good statistical accuracy, we want to send examples
of class i almost exclusively to either the left or the right subtree, thereby refining the purity of the
class distributions at subsequent levels in the tree. The purity of a tree node is therefore a measure
of whether the examples of each class reaching the node are then mostly sent to its one child node
(pure split) or otherwise to both children (impure split). The formal definitions of balancedness and
purity are introduced in Section 2.2. An objective expressing both criteria4 and resulting theoretical
properties are illustrated in the following sections. A key consideration in picking this objective is
that we want to effectively optimize it over hypotheses h ∈ H, while streaming over examples in
an online fashion5 . This seems unsuitable with some of the more standard decision tree objectives
such as Shannon or Gini entropy, which leads us to design a new objective. At the same time, we
show in Section 2.3 that under suitable assumptions, optimizing the objective also leads to effective
reduction of the average Shannon entropy over the entire tree.
2.2

An objective and analysis of resulting partitions

We now define a criterion to measure the quality of a hypothesis h ∈ H in creating partitions at a
fixed node n in the tree. Let πi denotes the proportion of label i amongst the examples reaching this
node. Let P (h(x) > 0) and P (h(x) > 0|i) denote the fraction of examples reaching n for which
h(x) > 0, marginally and conditional on class i respectively. Then we define the objective6 :
k
X
J(h) = 2
πi |P (h(x) > 0) − P (h(x) > 0|i)| .
(1)
i=1

We aim to maximize the objective J(h) to obtain high quality partitions. Intuitively, the objective
encourages the fraction of examples going to the right from class i to be substantially different from
the background fraction for each class i. As a concrete simple scenario, if P (h(x) > 0) = 0.5 for
some hypothesis h, then the objective prefers P (h(x) > 0|i) to be as close to 0 or 1 as possible for
each class i, leading to pure partitions. We now make these intuitions more formal.
Definition 1 (Purity). The hypothesis h ∈ H induces a pure split if
k
X
α :=
πi min(P (h(x) > 0|i), P (h(x) < 0|i)) ≤ δ,
i=1

where δ ∈ [0, 0.5), and α is called the purity factor.
In particular, a partition is called maximally pure if α = 0, meaning that each class is sent exclusively
to the left or the right. We now define a similar definition for the balancedness of a split.
Definition 2 (Balancedness). The hypothesis h ∈ H induces a balanced split if
c ≤ P (h(x) > 0) ≤ 1 − c,
{z
}
|
=β

where c ∈ (0, 0.5], and β is called the balancing factor.
A partition is called maximally balanced if β = 0.5, meaning that an equal number of examples
are sent to the left and right children of the partition. The balancing factor and the purity factor
are related as shown in Lemma 1 (the proofs of Lemma 1 and the following lemma (Lemma 2) are
deferred to the Supplementary material).
Lemma 1. For any hypothesis h, and any distribution over examples (x, y), the purity factor α and
the balancing factor β satisfy α ≤ min{(2 − J(h))/(4β) − β, 0.5}.
A partition is called maximally pure and balanced if it satisfies both α = 0 and β = 0.5. We see
that J(h) = 1 for a hypothesis h inducing a maximally pure and balanced partition as captured in
the next lemma. Of course we do not expect to have hypotheses producing maximally pure and
balanced splits in practice.
Lemma 2. For any hypothesis h : X 7→ {−1, 1}, the objective J(h) satisfies J(h) ∈ [0, 1].
Furthermore, if h induces a maximally pure and balanced partition then J(h) = 1.
4

We want an objective to achieve its optimum for simultaneously pure and balanced split. The standard
entropy-based criteria, such as Shannon or Gini entropy, as well as the criterion we will propose, posed in
Equation 1, satisfy this requirement (for the entropy-based criteria see [4], for our criterion see Lemma 2).
5
Our algorithm could also be implemented as batch or streaming, where in case of the latter one can for
example make one pass through the data per every tree level, however for massive datasets making multiple
passes through the data is computationally costly, further justifying the need for an online approach.
6
The proposed objective function exhibits some similarities with the so-called Carnap’s measure [22, 23]
used in probability and inductive logic.

2.3

Quality of the entire tree

The above section helps us understand the quality of an individual split produced by effectively
maximizing J(h). We next reason about the quality of the entire tree as we add more and more
nodes. We measure the quality of trees using the average entropy over all the leaves in the tree, and
track the decrease of this entropy as a function of the number of nodes. Our analysis extends the
theoretical analysis in [4], originally developed to show the boosting properties of the decision trees
for binary classification problems, to the multiclass classification setting.
Given a tree T , we consider the entropy function Gt as the measure of the quality of tree:


k
X X
1
Gt =
wl
πl,i ln
πl,i
i=1
l∈L

where πl,i ’s are the probabilities that a randomly chosen data point x drawn from P, where P is
a fixed target distribution over X , has label i given that x reaches node l, L denotes the set of all
tree leaves, t denotes the number of internal tree nodes, and wl is the weight
P of leaf l defined as the
probability a randomly chosen x drawn from P reaches leaf l (note that l∈L wl = 1).
We next state the main theoretical result of this paper (it is captured in Theorem 1). We adopt
the weak learning framework. The weak hypothesis assumption, captured in Definition 3, posits that
each node of the tree T has a hypothesis h in its hypothesis class H which guarantees simultaneously
a ”weak” purity and a ”weak” balancedness of the split on any distribution P over X . Under this
assumption, one can use the new decision tree approach to drive the error below any threshold.
Definition 3 (Weak Hypothesis Assumption). Let m denote any node of the tree T , and let βm =
P (hm (x) > 0) and Pm,i = P (hm (x) > 0|i). Furthermore, let γ ∈ R+ be such that for all m,
γ ∈ (0, min(βm , 1 − βm )]. We say that the weak hypothesis assumption is satisfied when for any
distribution P over X at each node m of the tree T there exists a hypothesis hm ∈ H such that

J(hm )/2 = i=1 πm,i |Pm,i − βm | ≥ γ.
Theorem 1. Under the Weak Hypothesis Assumption, for any α ∈ [0, 1], to obtain Gt ≤ α it suffices

splits.

We defer the proof of Theorem 1 to the Supplementary material and provide its sketch now. The
analysis studies a tree construction algorithm where we recursively find the leaf node with the highest
weight, and choose to split it into two children. Let n be the heaviest leaf at time t. Consider splitting
it to two children. The contribution of node n to the tree entropy changes after it splits. This change
(entropy reduction) corresponds to a gap in the Jensen’s inequality applied to the concave function,
and thus can further be lower-bounded (we use the fact that Shannon entropy is strongly concave
with respect to `1 -norm (see e.g., Example 2.5 in Shalev-Shwartz [24])). The obtained lower-bound
turns out to depend proportionally on J(hn )2 . This implies that the larger the objective J(hn )
is at time t, the larger the entropy reduction ends up being, which further reinforces intuitions to
maximize J. In general, it might not be possible to find any hypothesis with a large enough objective
J(hn ) to guarantee sufficient progress at this point so we appeal to a weak learning assumption. This
assumption can be used to further lower-bound the entropy reduction and prove Theorem 1.

3

The LOMtree Algorithm

The objective function of Section 2 has another convenient form which yields a simple online algorithm for tree construction and training. Note that Equation 1 can be written (details are shown in
Section 12 in the Supplementary material) as
J(h) = 2Ei [|Ex [1(h(x) > 0)] − Ex [1(h(x) > 0|i)]|].
Maximizing this objective is a discrete optimization problem that can be relaxed as follows
J(h) = 2Ei [|Ex [h(x)] − Ex [h(x)|i]|],
where Ex [h(x)|i] is the expected score of class i.
We next explain our empirical approach for maximizing the relaxed objective. The empirical estimates of the expectations can be easily stored and updated online in every tree node. The decision
whether to send an example reaching a node to its left or right child node is based on the sign of the
difference between the two expectations: Ex [h(x)] and Ex [h(x)|y], where y is a label of the data
point, i.e. when Ex [h(x)]−Ex [h(x)|y] > 0 the data point is sent to the left, else it is sent to the right.
This procedure is conveniently demonstrated on a toy example in Section 13 in the Supplement.
During training, the algorithm assigns a unique label to each node of the tree which is currently a
leaf. This is the label with the highest frequency amongst the examples reaching that leaf. While

testing, a test example is pushed down the tree along the path from the root to the leaf, where in each
non-leaf node of the path its regressor directs the example either to the left or right child node. The
test example is then labeled with the label assigned to the leaf that this example descended to.
The training algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1 where each tree node contains a classifier (we use
linear classifiers), i.e. hj is the regressor stored in node j and hj (x) is the value of the prediction
of hj on example x11 . The stopping criterion for expanding the tree is when the number of non-leaf
nodes reaches a threshold T .
3.1 Swapping

two children) if the examples that reached it in the past were coming from at least two different

classes. However, if the number of non-leaf nodes of the tree reaches threshold T , no more nodes
can be expanded and thus j cannot create children. Since the tree construction is done online, some
nodes created at early stages of training may end up useless because no examples reach them later
on. This prevents potentially useful splits such as at leaf j. This problem can be solved by recycling
orphan nodes (subroutine Swap in Algorithm 1). The general idea behind node recycling is to allow
nodes to split if a certain condition is met. In particular, node j splits if the following holds:
Cj −

max
i∈{1,2,...,k}

lj (i) > RS (Cr + 1),

(2)

where r denotes the root of the entire tree, Cj is the size of the smallest leaf in the subtree with root
j, where the smallest leaf is the one with the smallest total number of data points reaching it in the
past, lj is a k-dimensional vector of non-negative integers where the ith element is the count of the
number of data points with label i reaching leaf j in the past, and finally RS is a “swap resistance”.
The subtraction of maxi∈{1,2,...,k} lj (i) in Equation 2 ensures that a pure node will not be recycled.
If the condition in Inequality 2 is satisfied, the swap of the nodes is performed where an orphan
leaf s, which was reached by the smallest number of examples in the past, and its parent sPA are
detached from the tree and become children of node j whereas the old sibling sSIB of an orphan node
s becomes a direct child of the old grandparent sGPA . The swapping procedure is shown in Figure 2.
The condition captured in the Inequality 2 allows us to prove that the number of times any given
node is recycled is upper-bounded by the logarithm of the number of examples whenever the swap
resistance is 4 or more (Lemma 3).
Lemma 3. Let the swap resistance RS be greater or equal to 4. Then for all sequences of examples,
the number of times Algorithm 1 recycles any given node is upper-bounded by the logarithm (with
base 2) of the sequence length.

Experiments

We address several hypotheses experimentally.
1. The LOMtree algorithm achieves true logarithmic time computation in practice.
2. The LOMtree algorithm is competitive with or better than all other logarithmic train/test
time algorithms for multiclass classification.
3. The LOMtree algorithm has statistical performance close to more common O(k) approaches.
To address these hypotheses, we conTable 1: Dataset sizes.

The baselines we compared LOMtree with are a balanced random tree of logarithmic depth (Rtree)
and the Filter tree [5]. Where computationally feasible, we also compared with a one-against-all
classifier (OAA) as a representative O(k) approach. All methods were implemented in the Vowpal
Wabbit [25] learning system and have similar levels of optimization. The regressors in the tree nodes
for LOMtree, Rtree, and Filter tree as well as the OAA regressors were trained by online gradient
descent for which we explored step sizes chosen from the set {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8}. We used

we selected the best setting of the parameters (step size and number of passes) as the one minimizing
the validation error. Additionally, for the LOMtree we investigated different settings of the stopping
criterion for the tree expansion: T = {k − 1, 2k − 1, 4k − 1, 8k − 1, 16k − 1, 32k − 1, 64k − 1},

The first hypothesis is consistent with the experimental results. Time-wise LOMtree significantly
outperforms OAA due to building only close-to logarithmic depth trees. The improvement in the
training time increases with the number of classes in the classification problem. For instance on Aloi
training with LOMtree is 12.8 times faster than with OAA. The same can be said about the test time,

The third hypothesis is weakly consistent with the empirical results. The time advantage of LOMtree
comes with some loss of statistical accuracy with respect to OAA where OAA is tractable. We
conclude that LOMtree significantly closes the gap between other logarithmic time methods and
OAA, making it a plausible approach in computationally constrained large-k applications.

Conclusion

The LOMtree algorithm reduces the multiclass problem to a set of binary problems organized in a
tree structure where the partition in every tree node is done by optimizing a new partition criterion
online. The criterion guarantees pure and balanced splits leading to logarithmic training and testing
time for the tree classifier. We provide theoretical justification for our approach via a boosting
statement and empirically evaluate it on multiple multiclass datasets. Empirically, we find that this
is the best available logarithmic time approach for multiclass classification problems.
14
Note however that the mechanics of testing datastes are much easier - one can simply test with effectively
untrained parameters on a few examples to measure the test speed thus the per-example test time for OAA on
ImageNet and ODP is provided.
15
Also to the best of our knowledge there exist no state-of-the-art results of the OAA performance on these
datasets published in the literature.
