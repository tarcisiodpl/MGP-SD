Search for single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with high blocking temperature
(TB) is urgent for practical applications in magnetic recording, molecular
spintronics and quantum computing. Based on the First-principles calculations,
magnetic anisotropy energies (MAE) of the transition metal-Phthalocyanine (TM-Pc)
molecules are investigated and the mechanism that determines the MAE of TM-Pc
molecules is established. In particular, colossal MAE > 100 meV can be obtained by
adding an Os atom on RuPc and OsPc, so these molecules may offer ultrahigh
thermal stability in devices.
Extensive studies of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have evoked the emergence
of a new research field: molecular spintronics, where SMMs are used as the core building
blocks for recording, transport and sensing devices [1,2,3]. Typical SMMs comprise of
organic molecules and 3d transition metal (TM) cores (especially Mn, Fe and Co) and
their electronic and magnetic properties can be conveniently tuned by selecting
appropriate molecules or TM atoms [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5 ]. Among all SMMs, the
TM-Phthalocyanine (notated as TM-Pc) molecules have been mostly studied, with a
research history back to 100 years ago [6,7]. Aside from their promising electronic and
magnetic properties, TM-Pc molecules have simple atomic structures as depicted in Fig.
1(a) and high chemical and thermal stability in ambient [8]. In addition, TM-Pc
molecules may show interesting features when they are in contact with substrates. For
instance, a MnPc molecule on Pd(111) have two different magnetic ground states because
of the competition between Kondo screening and superconducting pair-breaking
interactions [9]. MnPc and CoPc molecules couple to a magnetic substrate through
RKKY interaction [10] and form an antiferromagnetic one-dimensional chain on Pb(111)
[11]. FePc molecules were found to switch their magnetic anisotropy to the perpendicular

direction on an oxidized Cu(110) surface [12,13]. Furthermore, the electronic and
magnetic properties of TM-Pc molecules can be modified upon adsorbing adatom [14] or
small molecule such as CO [15].
The main obstacle for the development of TM-Pc molecular devices is their low
blocking temperature, TB, a quantity that denotes the threshold temperature for holding
their spin orientations against thermal fluctuations [1]. Fundamentally, TB scales with the
magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), and typical TB of 3d TM-Pc molecules is less than
10 K (or equivalently, MAE ~ 1 meV) [16,17,18,19]. To keep stable magnetization of
molecules up to room temperature (RT) for practical applications, it is crucial to find
SMMs with EMCA larger than 30 or even 50 meV. Obviously, we need to seek potential
candidates from 4d or 5d TM-Pc molecules that have large spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
strength. Although all 4d and 5d TM-Pc molecules have been synthesized [20,21], studies
for their magnetic properties are rather rare.
In this paper, the electronic and magnetic properties of all TM-Pc molecules are
studied through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that only WPc
and RePc have moderate positive MAE ~ 22 meV. However, placing an additional Os
atom on RuPc and OsPc molecules can produce colossal MAEs as large as 223 and 136
meV, respectively. Furthermore, both new molecules (Os/RuPc and Os/OsPc) are
structurally stable. Therefore, they should be easy to fabricate and useful for various
molecular spintronics applications.
Our DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab-initio simulation package
(VASP) [22,23]. The interaction between valence electrons and ionic cores was described
within the framework of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [24,25]. The
spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the
exchange-correlation potentials and the effect of spin-orbit coupling was invoked
self-consistently [26]. The energy cutoff for the plane wave basis expansion was set to
400 eV. Periodic boundary condition was used with a large unit cell that ensures the
distance between two neighboring molecules larger than 15 Å, sufficient to mimic the
environment for single molecules. The atomic positions were fully relaxed with a
criterion that requires the force on each atom smaller than 0.01 eV/Å.

We adopted the Torque method proposed by Wang et al [ 27 , 28 ], for the
determination of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy,
MAE =

Here, θ is the polar angle away from the molecular axis for spin momentum, Ψi is the ith
relativistic eigenvector, and HSO is the SOC Hamiltonian [29]. Recently, we implemented
this method in the framework of pseudo-potential PAW method. To check the reliability
of the torque approach for cases with strong SOC, we also used the direct method to
calculate the MAE as [30,31]
MAE = E( θ=900) – E(θ=00).

(2)

Here, E represents the total energy of self-consistent calculations with the inclusion of
SOC for each spin orientation. Note that the direct method is much more expensive than
the torque method due to the need of large number of k points in the Brillouin zone for
periodic systems [27,28,29]. Furthermore, the torque method allows rigid band model
analysis for the prediction of MAE against the shift of the Fermi level, and also the
decomposition of MAE into contributions from different spin channels, atoms and
electronic states. For the convenience of discussions, we use MAE(uu), MAE(dd) and
MAE(ud+du) to denote the contributions from SOC interactions between the majority
spin states, minority spin states, and cross spin states, respectively.

and (c) are for planar and non-planar TM-Pc molecule, respectively. The cyan, blue, grey
and white spheres stand for TM, N, C and H atoms, respectively.
After structural relaxation, we found that most TM-Pc molecules prefer a planar
geometry as shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), whereas group IIIB and IVB cores (except Ti)

tend to stay out of the molecular plane as depicted in Fig. 1(c). In all planar molecules,
the TM-N bond lengths (dTM-N) are 1.95 ± 0.05 Å, regardless the size of core atoms due
to the constraint of the macrocycle. For the non-planar molecules, however, dTM-N may
vary from 2.09 Å to 2.35 Å. Moreover, their macrocycles also deform as described by
non-zero d2, the height of innermost N atoms above the molecular base-plane in Fig. 1(c).
The largest d1 and d2 (1.6 Å and 0.5 Å, respectively) were found in LaPc. Nevertheless,
the deformed structure for these elements is only the precursor of the more stable
bis(Phthalocyaninato)-TM structure (TM-Pc2), as extensively discussed for YPc2 and
TbPc2 [18,21].

FIG. 2. (a)-(c) Spin moment (MS) and orbital moment (ML) from nonrelativistic
calculations (SR) and relativistic calculations with spin orientation along z or x axis.
(d)-(f) Magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of the TM-Pc molecules. Both the torque
method and the full self-consistent calculations (SCF) with SOC were used to calculate
the MAE.
All core atoms in the TM-Pc molecules adopt the charge state of +2 (denoted as
TM2+), i.e., the two s electrons are donated to the neighboring N atoms. As a result, their
electronic configuration can be denoted as dn. Moreover, the D4h symmetry around the
TM cores splits the d orbitals into four groups: b1g (xy) and b2g (x2-y2) for the in-plane

components, along with a1g (z2) and eg (xz and yz) for the out-of-plane components with
the coordinate system given in Fig. 1(a). DFT calculations indicate that these orbitals
actually intermix with each other and also with N-2p states, and their energy sequences
and separations sensitively depend on the core atoms [32]. In general, the energy level of
the b1g orbital is higher than that of any other orbital So the spin magnetic moment (MS)
of a TM-Pc molecule follows a linear rule: MS = n µB (n ≤ 4); MS = (8 – n)µB (5 ≤ n ≤ 8);
or MS = (10 – n)µB (n=9 or 10), as shown by the black lines in Fig. 2(a)-(c). Consequently,
the largest MS is 4.0 µB for molecules in the d4 configuration (CrPc, MoPc and WPc),
while NiPc, PdPc, PtPc and IIB-Pc (ZnPc, CdPc and HgPc) molecules are nonmagnetic.
When the SOC effect is invoked, the values of MS of most 4d and 5d TM-Pc molecules
decrease, but those of the 3d TM-Pc molecules remain almost unchanged, as shown in
Fig. 2(a)-(c). In addition, we found that the values of MS for in-plane [MS(x)] and
perpendicular [MS(z)] magnetizations are almost the same for all cases except OsPc of
which the MS(z) is much smaller than the MS(z) (0.5 µB v.s. 1.7 µB), manifesting the giant
spin anisotropy of OsPc.
The calculated MAEs with both the torque and direct methods are plotted in Fig.
2(d)-(f). Interestingly, these two methods produce the same trend of MAEs for all TM-Pc
molecules as the atomic number of the core atom changes. In fact, the two approaches
produce almost the same MAEs for most cases with only a few exceptions such as FePc,
CoPc, RhPc, and OsPc. It appears that the perturbative torque method is very reliable for
the determination of magnetic anisotropy of TM-Pc molecules, even the charge and spin
densities are frozen during the reorientation of magnetization, and we will use results
obtained from the torque method in the following discussions for the easiness of analyses.
Clearly, 3d-, 4d- and 5d-Pc molecules follow the similar trend in the MAE ~ n
dependence, with an exception VPc. First, all d1 (Sc, Y and La) and d9 (Cu, Ag and Au)
TM-Pc molecules have negligible MAEs, which means that they have no obviously
preferential direction of magnetization. The d2 (Ti, Zr and Hf) TM-Pc molecules slightly
prefer in-plane magnetization, manifested by their small negative MAEs. The MAEs
become positive for the d3 (Nb and Ta), d4 (Cr, Mo and W) and d5 (Mn, Tc and Re)
TM-Pc molecules, so they have perpendicular magnetization. The MAEs turn to negative
again for the d6 (Fe, Ru and Os) and d7 (Co, Rh and Ir) TM-Pc molecules and the largest
magnitude is 57 meV for OsPc (from the direct approach). Nevertheless, since the

in-plane anisotropy with the change of azimuthal angle is relatively small (e.g., 8 meV
for OsPc with an easy axis that is 45o away from the x-axis), only molecules with large
positive MAEs are useful to withhold thermal fluctuation. To this end, it appears that
only WPc and RePc are suitable candidates among neutral TM-Pc molecules, with MAEs

FIG. 3. (a) and (b) PDOS of 3d orbitals of Re and Os (upper panels) and total and
decomposed MAEs from the torque method with rigid band model (lower panels). Note
that the energy levels of b1g orbital are out of the energy range. The zero energy is set to
the natural EF of each TM-Pc molecule. (c) The total MAE as a function of number of
valence electrons for RePc and OsPc. The vertical straight lines indicate the number of
electrons of neutral TM-Pc molecules.
Nevertheless, the charge state of TM-Pc molecules can be manipulated and the
MAE of charged molecules are also of practical interest. To demonstrate the relationship
between MAE and electronic structures, we present the projected density of states (PDOS)
of different d-orbitals of RePc and OsPc molecules in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), along with the
total and decomposed occupancy-dependent MAEs with the rigid band model. It can be
seen that the arrangements of the d-orbitals are sensitive to their electron occupancies,
due to the significant change of the interaction between the TM atom and the surrounding
N atoms when the TM atom vary from one to another. As for the EF-dependent MAEs, it
can be seen that both the magnitude and sign of MAEs change when the EF is shifted
away for the position for neutral molecule. In particular, giant positive MAE can be
obtained for RePc, 44 meV, when the EF shifts downward by 0.1 eV—corresponding to

[RePc]1+ as seen in Fig. 3(c); and for OsPc, 75 meV, when the EF shifts downward by 0.2
eV—corresponding to and [OsPc]2+. In contrast, MAEs of both RePc and OsPc
molecules are negative if one shift the Fermi level upwards, i.e., by adding electron(s) to
them. Accordingly, the TB of these positively charged molecules can be much higher than
the room temperature (~ 30 meV).
The spin decompositions of MAEs in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) provide more insights for the
manipulation of MAE. For example, the cross spin contributions, MAE(ud+du), are
dominant for the neutral RePc molecule, whereas the minority spin contribution,
MAE(dd), plays the major role for the neutral OsPc molecule. In this case, MAE(ud+du)
remains to be large and MAE(uu) is negligible in a broad energy range, from -0.4 eV to
0.4 eV, so one only needs to reduce MAE(dd) to attain large positive total MAE. This can
be done by emptying d-electrons in the minority spin channel, as discussed above for the
positively charged RePc and OsPc molecules.
Note that the trend of MAE curves in Fig. 3 can be easily traced to their electronic
origins through the following expression [13,33]

MAE = ξ

Here ξ is the strength of SOC; εu,α and εo,β are the energy levels of the unoccupied states
with spin α ( 𝑢, 𝛼 ) and occupied states with spin β ( 𝑜, 𝛽 ), respectively. Lx and Lz are
angular momentum operators along the x and z directions, respectively. Since the eg
orbitals have different magnetic quantum numbers (m=±1) from the a1g (m=0) and b1g
(m=±2) orbitals, SOC interaction across these orbitals results in negative MAE(dd), as
shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) for the RePc and OsPc molecules. On the other hand, the
summations of SOC matrix elements 𝑢, 𝛼 𝐿! 𝑜, 𝛽 and 𝑢, 𝛼 𝐿! 𝑜, 𝛽 also give the
orbital moments when the spin aligns along the x and z axes, respectively [34]. This
implies that the MAE and orbital moment (ML) usually have the accordant anisotropy
[34,35,36]. Indeed, we can see in Fig. 2 that the amplitudes of ML(x) are larger than those
of ML(x) for cases with in-plane easy axis, i.e., negative MAEs.
Knowing that [RePc]1+ and [OsPc]2+ may have large positive MAEs, now the
questions is how to achieve the positively charged state for these molecules which

actually have appreciable electron affinities and hence prefer negatively charged state
[37]. Adsorption of oxidizing atom on the core atom is certainly one of the possible
approaches, so we investigated the effect of H, N, O, and F adatoms on top of the RePc
and OsPc molecules. Although all atoms except N strongly bind to Re and Os, the strong
chemical effect of these adatoms significantly change the arrangements of TM-5d orbitals.
As a result, the prediction of MAE from the rigid band model as illustrated in Fig. 3 is not
applicable and only H on RePc (H/RePc) gives large positive MAE of 25 meV as listed in
table I.

The alternative way is to use transition metal dimers, as extensively discussed by
several authors [35,36,38,39]. Using the same strategy, we place an Os atom on the top of
RuPc and OsPc molecules. After structural relaxation, vertical Os-Ru and Os-Os dimers
form right in the middle of these molecules, with bond lengths of 2.2 and 2.3 Å,
respectively. To further demonstrate the stability of these new Os/RuPc and Os/OsPc
molecules, we allow the dissociation of Ru-Os and Os-Os bonds along two pathways, as
indicated in Fig. 4. From the energy profiles for Os/RuPc, it can be seen that the removal
of Os from the central site of RuPc or OsPc requires high energy costs, 1.7-1.9 eV, so the
Os-Re and Os-Os dimers should be extremely stable. Strikingly, the MAEs of Os/RuPc
and Os/OsPc are as large as 223 and 136 meV, as listed in table I. These colossal MAEs
are sufficient for any technical applications, such as molecular spintronic junction and
magnetic storage. To this end, one may need to protect these TM-Pc molecules from
interacting with their environment, which is beyond the scope of this work. One
encouraging recent experimental progress is that the direct interaction between TM-Pc
molecule and substrate can be significantly reduced by placing the molecule on a (2x1)
reconstructed Au(110) surfaces [40]. Our predictions should inspire more experimental

efforts for the design of innovative magnetic molecules and environments.

In summary, we systematically studied the electronic and magnetic properties of the
TM-Pc molecules using density functional calculations and found that WPc and RePc
have large positive MAEs (~ 22 meV). Based on rigid band model analysis, we
elucidated the principles that govern the MAE of TM-Pc molecules and predicted that the
positively charged [RePc]1+ and [OsPc]2+ have huge positive MAEs: 44 and 75 meV,
respectively. Strikingly, adsorption of an Os atom above RuPc or OsPc molecule results
in stable vertical dimer structures and colossal MAEs: 223 meV for Os/RePc or 136 meV
for Os/OsPc. We believe these molecules can serve as the smallest units for magnetic
recording and logic operation, and should be very useful in other room temperature
molecular spintronics applications.
