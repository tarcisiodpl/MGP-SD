The search of new topological insulators that demonstrate the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is
a cutting-edge research topic in condensed matter physics and materials science. So far, the QAHE has been
observed only in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 at extremely low temperature. Therefore, it is important to find new
materials with large topological band gap and high thermal stability for the realization of the QAHE. Based on
first-principles and tight-binding model calculations, we discovered a new class of topological phase—Chern
half metal which manifests the QAHE in one spin channel while is metallic in the other spin channel—in Co
or Rh deposited graphene. The QAHE is robust in these sytems for the adatom coverage ranging from 2% to
6%. Meanwhile, these systems have large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energies of 5.3 and 11.5 meV,
necessary for the observation of the QAHE at reasonably high temperature.

The recent discovery of topological insulators (TIs)—that
act as insulators in their bulks yet possess quantized conducting edge or surface states—has triggered extremely active multidisciplinary research activities for the exploration
of new fundamental science and exotic materials [1–6]. One
of the most interesting phenomena in this realm is the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) which is the combined
consequence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and reduction
of the time-reversal symmetry due to intrinsic magnetization.
These magnetic TIs, also called as Chern insulators since the
QAHE is characterized by nonzero integer Chern numbers
[7, 8], can be produced by using impurities [9, 10], adatoms
[11–13], or substrate [14, 15] along with regular TIs such as
graphene and Bi-based compounds. Furthermore, it is necessary to align their magnetization along the surface normal,
in analog to the geometry of conventional anomalous Hall effect [16]. Therefore, the realization of the QAHE in experiment is challenging. The only experimental observation of the
QAHE was reported recently in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 in an
extreme experimental condition below 0.1 K [17], due to the
tiny TI gap and other complex factors in dealing with surfaces
of three-dimensional TIs. Obviously, searching for more feasible Chern insulators especially in simple two-dimensional
(2D) systems with large nontrivial band gaps is of great importance for the realization and exploitation of the QAHE.
The TI gaps of Chern insulators reported so far can be
sorted into two groups, depending on the strength of intrinsic magnetization (Mex ). As presented by the schematic band
structures in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), most Chern insulators reported in literature [9–12, 17] have the type-I TI gap which
is produced by the interspin SOC interaction under moderate
Mex . The type-II TI gap which is induced by the intraspin
SOC interaction [Fig. 1(c) and 1(d)] under large Mex was
also predicted in an organic material [18]. Obviously, there
can be another type of SOC induced band gap [denoted as
type-III in Fig. 1(b)], that may lead to a half metallic feature.
If the Fermi level (EF ) is within the gap, one may expect that
the spin channel with the gap behaves like a Chern insulator,

whereas the other spin channel is metallic. In this sense, materials with the type-III gap can be classified as Chern half
metals — a new class of topological materials for spintronics
applications.
Graphene is an excellent template to realize the QAHE in
2D systems at high temperature, due to its structural simplicity and stability. Huge TI gaps can be produced in graphene by
adatoms, through hybridization with its π bands [19, 20]. The
QAHE was predicted in Fe [11] or W [12] deposited graphene,
with type-I TI gaps of 5.5 or ∼30 meV. However, the spin orientation of adatoms in both cases lies in the graphene plane
(see Fig. S1 and Ref. [12]), rather than perpendicular to it as
required by the QAHE. Clearly, it is equally important to determine the magnetic anisotropy energies of potential Chern
insulators, for the correct alignment of their magnetization
and also for their thermal stability.
In this paper, we use the first-principles and tight-binding
(TB) model calculations to demonstrate that the graphene with
Co or Rh adatoms can be excellent Chern half metals. Both
Co/graphene and Rh/graphene have giant type-III TI gaps (50
and 100 meV, respectively) and nonzero integer Chern num-

may offer new opportunities for the design of spin filters and
spintronics devices.
To explore the origin of the topological properties of
Co/graphene, we plot the Ω(k) along the high symmetric direction in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (2DBZ) in Fig.
3(a). There are two pronounced peaks around the middle
points of ΓK and ΓM. From the velocity matrix elments
hvx(y) i, we found that the coupling between the highest valence band and lowest conduction band in the minority spin
channel (refered as ‘VB’ and ‘CB’) plays the dominant role
in Ω(k). The nonzero hψCB,k |vx |ψV B,k i requires selection
rules of ∆l = ±1 and ∆m = ±1. Accordingly, the Ω(k)
must be from the hybridization between the Co dxz/yz and
graphene π states. If we decouple the wavefunctions of VB
and CB as ψnk = Cdn φd + Cπn φπ , we found that the weight
of the π states |Cπ |2 is very small around the Γ point and increases significantly near the middle points of ΓK and ΓM as
shown in Fig. 3(b). On the other hand, the energy separation
between these two bands increases rapidly beyond the middle
points of ΓK and ΓM, which leads to an abrupt decrease of
Ω(k). More complete information regarding the distribution
of Ω(k) in the whole 2DBZ is displayed in the upper panel of
Fig. 3(c). For comparison, we also plotted the distribution of
the Ω(k) of the gap ∆2 in the lower panel of Fig. 3(c). It can
be seen that large areas in the BZ have contributions to Ω(k)
of ∆1 , but only very tiny regions around the K and K0 points
where bands cross have contribution to Ω(k) of ∆2 .
It is known that nonzero integer Chern numbers for the
type-I and type-II TI gaps of an infinite 2D material guarantee
the existence of quantized edge states when the material is cut
into one-dimensional ribbons [7]. To check whether similar
quantized edge states exist for the type-III gap ∆1 , we developed a TB model with the Hamiltonian H = Hg + Ha + Hc
[20] to directly study the electronic structure of a Co/graphene

nanoribbon (NR). Here, Hg , Ha and Hc describe graphene,
Co, and the hopping between Co 3d orbitals and graphene π
orbitals, respectively. The details about our TB Hamiltonian
can be found in the Supplemental Material. The parameters
were obtained by fitting the DFT band structures of the 4 × 4
Co/graphene in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b). The TB band structures
(Fig. S5) agree with the DFT band structures very well, which
demonstrates the high quality of our approach for the description of Co/graphene.
We used a graphene NR with zigzag edges on both sides
[Fig. 4(a)] to show the existence of the quantized edge states.
The width of the graphene NR is 200 zigzag C chains, and
the periodicity along the y-axis is 4 times of that of graphene.
The Co adatoms with a coverage of 6.25% are distributed uniformly on the graphene NR. The corresponding band structures without and with SOC in the one-dimensional Brillouin
zone (1DBZ) are plotted in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). It can be
seen that the dxz/yz bands near the EF remain close without
SOC. When SOC is invoked, they are separated by about 54
meV, slightly smaller than the gap ∆1 (58 meV) of the 2D
Co/graphene [Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5]. Interestingly, we can
see that two gapless bands cross the bulk gap ∆1 , presumably being from the edges. To prove this, we calculated the
weights of all atoms for the wavefunctions of the states A and
B as marked in Fig. 4(c). The summations over atoms with
the same x position are plotted in Fig. 4(d). Clearly, their
wavefunctions indeed localize near the right and left edges,
respectively, and the weights decay very rapidly to zero towards the center of the Co/graphene NR. The depth of the
edge states is about 22 Å. We want to point out that the edge
states do not interact with the majority spin states even they
cross each other in the gap ∆1 , as presented in Fig. 4(c).

contribute to the quantized conductance. Because the velocity
of conducting electrons can be calculated as ~v (k) = ∇E(k),
the electrons on the right edge move along the y direction,
while the electrons on the left edge move oppositely. Moreover, there is only one conducting channel at each edge, corresponding to the Chern number C = 1 as discussed above.
We also directly calculated the energy-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (Rxy ) of Co/graphene with the LandauerButtiker formula [34–36] in a setup shown in Fig. 5(a). Although it appears to be difficult to detect the topological edge
states in Chern half metals with one spin channel being metallic, the simplicity of the two-dimensional geometry, the large
topological band gap, and the high magnetic anisotropy energy we discussed here should be attractive for fundamental
studies and device applications. In particular, one may use
spin filter materials for the leads in Fig. 5(a), such as ferromagnetic half metal SrRuO4 , so that only the minority spin
current flows through the graphene ribbon. The voltage drop
Vxy on the two edges can be measured across leads 3 and 4,
and Rxy is defined as Rxy = Vxy /I (in the unit of h/e2 ).
Details of these calculations are shown in the Supplemental
Material. From the EF -dependent Rxy in Fig. 5(b), we can
see plateaus above the EF which correspond to the topological edge states. For the 64 × 64 graphene nanosheet with
Co coverage of 6.6%, we found that Rxy may approach to
1 for EF varying from 0 to 40 meV. For other cases with
smaller graphene ribbon or lower Co coverage, Rxy still remains larger than 0.97.
We should point out that the edge states in the minority spin
channel are well separated from the bulk states in the majority
spin channel, as shown in Fig. 4(c). However, states of different spins are expected to be mixed in realistic cases where Co

adatoms are randomly distributed, which may ruin the quantization of the Rxy . To see if the QAHE is robust, different
random distribution patterns were calculated for a 48 × 48
graphene nanosheet with Co coverages of 1.6%, 2.2%, 3.3%
and 6.6%, and the averaged values of Rxy are plotted in Fig.
5(c). It is important that the curves of Rxy show plateaus even
as the coverage of Co is only about 2%. The peak value of
Rxy reaches 0.99 for the Co coverage of 6.6%, indicating the
robustness of the QAHE in this case against the randomization
of Co adatoms. Moreover, the deviation of Rxy from the theoretical value (i.e. h2 /e) for the lower-coverage cases should
mainly come from the finite size effect in our numerical calculations. Therefore we believe that the QAHE plateau is observable, as long as the the coverage is between 2% ∼ 6%
and the size of graphene sheet is large enough. This coverage
range is estimated based on the requirements of adequately
large ∆1 yet negligible direct Co-Co interaction for the realization of QAHE.
To estimate the temperature limit for the observation of
the QAHE, we need consider a few factors. (i) The MAE
of 5.3 meV ensures the perpendicular spin orientation stable
up to ∼ 60 K. (ii) The TI gap (indirect/direct band gap of
35.7/58 meV) in minority spin channel is larger than the exciton energy at room temperature. (iii) The energy barrier of
Co adatom diffusion on graphene is about 0.4 eV [33], which
implies that the aggregation of Co adatoms can be avoided below 100 K. In fact, recent experiment revealed that over 90%
Co adatoms on graphene exist as monomer [25]. Therefore,
the temperature limit to observe the QAHE in Co/graphene in
experiment mainly depends on the stability of the perpendicular spin orientation, i.e. ∼ 60 K which is much higher than
that in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2 Te3 [17].
The TI gap and MAE may be further enhanced if we use Rh
because of its stronger SOC strength. We found that the band
structures of Rh/graphene (Fig. S4) are very similar with those
of Co/graphene, except that the EF locates at 20 meV above
the conduction band minimum in the minority spin channel,
due to the smaller exchange splitting (MS = 0.8 µB ). Obviously, the size of the type-III gap ∆1 is much larger than
that of Co/graphene, with the indirect (direct) gap of 100
(118) meV. A Chern number of C = 1 is obtained for ∆1 of
Rh/graphene, which is thus also a Chern half metal and should
have more robust topological features than Co/graphene. Furthermore, the MAE of Rh/graphene is 11.5 meV, which indicates the perpendicular spin orientation to be stable up to ∼
140 K.
In summary, Co/graphene and Rh/graphene are revealed
to be excellent Chern half metals, through DFT calculations
and TB model analyses. We found that the Co/graphene and
Rh/graphene have huge type-III TI gaps (about 50 and 100
meV) and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energies
(5.3 and 11.5 meV). Therefore, they are ideal model systems

expect that the TI phase found here may be generalized to
other materials. The pure and dissipationless spin current at
the edges of Chern half metals may find significant applica-
