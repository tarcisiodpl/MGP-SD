Influence diagram is a graphical representa­
tion of belief networks with uncertainty. This
article studies the structural properties of a
probabilistic model in an influence diagram.
In particular, structural controllability the­
orems and structural observability theorems
are developed and algorithms are formulated.
Controllability and observability are funda­
mental concepts in dynamic systems (Luen­
berger 1979). Controllability corresponds to
the ability to control a system \vhile observ­
ability analyzes the inferability of its vari­
ables. Both properties can be determined by
the ranks of the system matrices. Structural
controllability and observability, on the other
hand, analyze the property of a system with
its structure only, without the specific knowl­
edge of the values of its elements (Lin 1974,
Shields and Pearson 1976). The structural
analysis explores the connection between the
structure of a model and the functional de­
pendence among its elements. It is useful
in co mp rehending problem and formulating
solution by challenging the underlying intu­
itions and detecting inconsistency in a model.
This type of qualitative reasoning can some­
times provide insight even when there is in­
sufficient numerical information in a model.

Introduction

Influence diagram is a graphical representation for

probabilistic and decision models. It was developed
by Howard and Matheson (Howard 1984). Many ap­
proaches have been explored to analyze an influence
diagram (Shachter 1988) since then.

Components of an influence diagram

An

influence diagram contains directed arcs and nodes
which together represent probabilistic and determinis­
tic variables, decisions, objectives and the functional
relations among them as shown in figure 1:

Here is a simple model represented with an influence
diagram: In a manufacturing process, a wafer needs
to be set at a particular temperature before a chem­
ical bath operation. The wafer is heated in an oven
in advance, however, there is some heat loss during
the transportation of the wafer from the oven t.o the
chemical bath. The uncertainty lies in the fact that. the
heat loss is a probabilistic distribution, it varies with
the room temperature and transporting time. The sit­
uation is modeled with an influence diagram as shown
in figure 2.
Before any detail numerical analysis, it is prudent to
verify that a model is robust. As indicated in the di­
agram, wafer temperature is a function of the oven
temperature and heat loss. The wafer temperature

cannot be set accurately without better understanding
and control of the heat loss. It is fruitless trying to im­
prove the process if this critical issue is ignored. The
major effort should be focused on the maintenance of
the room temperature and reduction of transportation
time rather than the design of a more accurate oven.
This type of information can be deduced from the
structure ( nodes and arcs ) of the model without know­
ing its exact functions and numerical values. Such
structural analysis is even more important in large in­
fluence diagrams consisting of thousands of arcs and
node s .

Controllability and observability are fundamental con­
cepts in dynamic systems. The nth order dynamic sys­
tem x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) is controllable if for
.r(O) = 0 and any given n vector x1 there exists a finite

index Nand a sequence of inputs u(O),u(1), ... ,u(N-1)
such that this input sequence, applied to the system,
yields x(N) = x1 ( Luenberger 1979). The system is
structurally controllable if and only if'Vf > 0, the r e
exists a completely controllable system y ;;;:= Atx+Bt u,
of the same structure1 as y = Ax + Bu such that
II A1 -A II< i and II Bt - B II<£ ( Lin 1974).

Consider the following example: y

= ax + bu.
y is
called structurally controllable because it can be set
to any value by changing u, except in very rare coin­

cidence such as b = 0.

i(t +I)= A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t)
and input variables at time t, whereas A and
system matrices.

If a dynamic graph (Murota 1987, Yamada 1990) ofthe
above model is drawn based on the influence diagram
notation, it will look like figure 3. As we will see later
in the paper, this system is controllable.

Observability is a dual concept of controllability. T e
dynamic system x(k + 1) = Ax(k), y(k) = Cx(k) 1s
completely observable if there is a finite index N such

that knowledge of the outputs y(O),y(l), ... ,y(N -1) is
sufficient to determine the value of the initial state
x(O) (Luenberger 1979). The system is structurally
observable if and only if 'Vt > 0, there exists a
completely observable system x(k + 1) = Atx(k),

y1(k) = C1x(k) of the same structure as x(k + 1) =
Ax(k), y(k) = Cx(k) such that II A1 -A II< i and
II C1 -c II< i.

Y = f(Pt ,p2, . . . , Pn). (See figure 4)
And the relations hip of a probabilistic node x wi th its

z = I(Pl, P2, ... , Pn, i), where ( is an uncontrollable
variable. (See figure 5)

It. is obvious that different functional classes such as
linear, quadratic, Boolean, and so forth in a model will
prescribe different system behav ior. Since we are an­
alyzing the structural propertie s of a model without
the knowledge of its specific functions nor v alues , we
need to tighten the functional dom ain slightly in or­
der to derive any meaning results. We assume that
the models we are studying have generically infera ble
functions. Most linear funct.ions and many nonlinear
functions have such property.

observable if the values of all its parents are
known. (See figure 6)

Proof: A deterministic node y is a function of its par­

Proof: Directly from definition of generic inferability
in the m=O case.
Consider a simple f : R1 - R1 case: Let x = result
of a coin flip, there is a 50-50 chance of a head or tail.
And let y = winning based on the result of coin flip,
receives one dollar if it is a head and nothing if it is a
tail. (See figure 8)
z

is a probabilistic random variable and y is a de­
terministic variable given the result of x. Now if the
result of the flip is known, the winning can be deter­
mined. On the other hand, if you know whether any
money is received, the result of the coin flip (which is
a probabilistic random variable) can be inferred.

Corollary 2: If a chain is formed with several deter­

ministic nodes, all nodes in the chain are observ­
able if any one of them is known.
2.2

Algorithm to determine structural
observability

1. For each unknown deterministic node, check if all
its parents are known, if they are, mark the child
node as 'observable' and mark the arcs between
parents and child as 'blocked'. A 'blocked' arc
means this relation cannot provide further observ­
ability information in the influence diagram.

Structural Controllability and Observability in Influence Diagrams

2. For all known deterministic nodes:
(a) Pa rti tion the deterministic nodes into family
equivalence3 classes.
•

If two deterministic nodes are s iblings4
then they must be in the same family
class.

(b )

For each family class:
i.

Form a bipartite graph with all the known
deterministic nodes and their unknown
parents.

ii. If there is a complete matching of k par­
ents with k deterministic known children,
and all unknown parents of these k chil­
dren are included in the matching, then
these k parents can be marked as 'observ­
able' and the associated arcs marked as
'blocked'.
If k parents are covered by more than k
deterministic children, this situation cor­
responds to the generating of several de­
terministic children from the same par­
ent. Redundant data should be verified
to check system consistency.
iii. The search is repeated until no more such
set of k parents can be found.

Option Investment Example

The price of a stock option is a function of the current
stock price, the strike price, time to expiration, risk
free intere st rate, and stock volatiliti5. Among these
five factors, the first four can be measured objectively
from market data. The last one, stock volatility, is
subjective and is based on people's beliefs of the fluc­
tuation of the stock price in the future.

that the implied volatility (which is based on people's
beliefs) should be within a narrow range of the histor­
ical volatility data. If the two differ beyond a certain
margin, there is an investment opportunity.

The investment decision is modeled with an influence
diagram as seen in fi gu re 11. Since the optio� ·� price
is listed, and all the factors except the volatthty are

known, the implied volatility is observable (from corol­
lary 1: all but one case). The historical data can e
obtained from market database, therefore the volatil­
ity gap is determined (from theorem 1: all parents
known case ) . A decision can now be made whether to
play the strategy or not based on the input from the
volatility gap.

Algorithm to determine structural
controllability

1. Check if the target set of control contains value
nodes and/ or deterministic nodes only. If not, the
set, as a whole is not structurally controllable.

2.

Check that the number of decision nodes is greater
than or equal to the number of nodes in the target
set.

3.

Check that decision nodes are not predecessors
of any observed nodes. If they are, the values of
those decision nodes may be observable but the
nodes cannot be used as control, since decisions
have already been predetermined.

4.

Construct. node disjoint paths with max-flow
method.
Decision nodes are sources, and the
nodes in the target set are the sinks. The flow ca­
pacity of every deterministic node is one and the
flow capacity of every probabilistic node is zero.
Target set is not structurally controllable if not
enough node disjoint paths can be found.

Proof:

Theorem 4: If the functions are generically nimble,
a set V of nodes v;(l � i � n) are structurally
controllable if

5. Let Y contains all the nodes on the node disjoint
paths, and P contains all parents of nodes in Y.
Check that all nodes in P - Y are structurally
observable (with the structural observabilit.y algo­
rithm described in the previous section), or con­
trollable by some other additional decision nodes.

6. If all of the abov� conditions are satisfied, then
target set of control is structurally controllable.
If not , go to step 4 and try to find other node
disjoint paths agai'l.

Products in a factory example

Consider the products in a factory dynamic system
discussed earlier in section 1. Since the initial states
of X, Y, and Z (at time 0) are given, all the values
of X, Y, and Z at subsequent times are observable.
Furthermore, we can find three node disjoint paths
from the controls to the values:
U(2) to X(3)
U(l) to X(2) to Z(3)
U(O) to X(1) to Z(2) to Y(3)
Therefore, the system is structural controllable8 At
time T=3, X, Y, and Z can be set to any values we
want (See figure 13).

Wafer heat loss example

Let us consider the wafer heat loss problem again. As
before, the heat loss is a function of the room tempera­
ture and transportation time. But now the transporta­
tion is automated with a conveyer belt and therefore
the transporting time is constant. Furthermore, the
room temperature is relative stable and can be mea­
sured. The modified model is drawn in figure 14.

Since the room temperature and transportation time

are observed, the heat loss can be calculated. In addi­
tion, there is a deterministic node path from the oven
dial to the wafer temperature. The oven temperature
can be raised slightly higher to compensate exactly
9For partial structural controllability problems in dy­
namic systems, an additional step to verify g lobal nimble
property might be needed (Chan 1992). Dynamic systems
have stationary functions that replicate in each period,
they lend themselves more easily into mutual dependence
cases ( Murota 1990).

Conclusions

We have described the structural controllability and
observability theorems in influence diagrams. The
ability to analyze a probabilistic model with its struc­
ture is important in the design and comprehension of
a system.
It is especially useful in model validation
and rapid prototype constructions in large probabilis­
tic systems.
