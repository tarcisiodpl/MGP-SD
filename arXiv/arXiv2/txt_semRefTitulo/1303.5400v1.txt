INTRODUCTION

Probabilistic causal networks (PCNs) [1. 11] have re­
rently become very popular in many practical do­
mains. such as medical diagnosis [8]. vision [10). lan­
guage unde rsta nding [7]. and map learning [5). A
major difficulty in constructing these networks is pro­
viding prior and conditional probabilities that quan­
tify root nodes and causal dependencies. Most people
find these probabilities overly detailed and counterin­
tuitive [6). The work described in this paper attempts
to overcome this difficulty by introducing the notion
of objection-based causal networks (OCNs). Root
nodes and causal dependencies in OCNs are quanti­
fied by providing obj ections rather than probabilities.
In PCNs. a causal dependency between n od es is
quantified by providing a number in the interval [0.1].
For example. the depeudency from .4 = "Tlw grass is
wet'' to B = "My shoes are wet" may be quantified by
p = .�5. The number pis int.erpret.ed as a conditional
probability of the effect B given the cause A. Condi­

tional probabilities are usually assessed by a domain
expert or obtained from statistical data. However.
most domain experts have difficulty assessing these
probabilities and stat-istical data may not always be
available [6. 1).
In OCNs, a causal dependency between nodes is
quantified hy providing a logical sentence under

.

One could state at least three factors that make PCNs
so popular. First, PCNs allow the representation of
non-binary beliefs, which is not. allowed by classical
logic representations. Next, constructing a consistent
PCN is much easier and more systematic than con­
structing a consistent classical logic theory. Finally,
PCNs an• based on probability theory. which sup­
ports many patterns of plausible reasoning [11. 12)
that. are not supported by classical logic.
OCNs enjoy all the above properties. Section 2 shows
that an OCN can be interpreted as a state of belief
that allows non-binary beliefs. Section 3 shows that
constructing a consistent OCN is very similar to con­
structing a PCN. Finally. Section 4 shows how to
compute a state of belief represented by an OCN,
and Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.

OBJECTION-BASES STATES OF
BELIEF

In probability calculus. we assess our ronfidence in a
sentence by providing a number in the interval [U. 1).
If we have complete confid e nce in a sentence. we give
it a probability of l; otherwise, we give it a probabil­
ity of less than one. Another way to assess our con­
fidence in a. sentence is by providing an objectiOn to
that sentence. For example. an objection to ''Twf:'ety
is a bird implies Tweety flies" is "Tweety is wing­
less." This choice of assessing one's confidence leads
to objection calculus. which underlies objection-bas�>d
states of belief and causal net.works.
Se<'lion 2.1 shows that an objection-based causal net-

If degrees of support are probabili ties . then a state
of belief and the causal network representing it are
called probabilistic. F i gure I and Tab le 2 constitute
a PCN. On the other hand, if d egrees of support are
objections. then a state of belief and the causal net­
work r e pre"ent i ng it. are called objection-ba'>ed. Fig­
ure 1 and Table 3 c onst.i tut e an OCN.
From here on. I assum e that objections are sentences
in a propositional language 0. I also assume that

primitive prop osi tions of the languages C and ('J are
disjoint.

CONSISTENCY

Probability theory imposes three consistency condi­
tions on probabilistic states of belief. First. the pr ob ­
ability of a t au tology must be one. Second. the prob­

ability of a disjunction of logically disjoint sent.enres

must be the sum of the probabilities of each of the dis­
jun cts. Finally. equivalent sentences mu st have equal

probabilit-ies. An objection-ba<oed state of belief ell

quantified causal network. The topology of this graph
contains i nfor mati on that partiall y defines a s t ate of
belief. and is the subject of Section 3.3. Another com­
pon ent of a causal net work consists of prior degrees
of s upport These a re either probabilities or objec­

the su bjec t of Section 3.1. T he last comp onent of a
causal network consists of conditional degrees of sup­
port. These are either probabilities or objections that
quantify causal dependen cies in t he network and are
the subject of Section 3.2. The three components of
a causal netw ork fully define a state of belief.

IRRELEVANCE

The third component of a causal net.work is a directed
graph such as the one depicted in Figure l. The
syntax of the graph does not depend on whether it is
part of a PCN or an OCN, but its interpretation (the
information it represents) does.
Informally. the directed graph of a causal network

Figure 1. once we know that "The grass is wet, .. the
information "It rained" does not. ch ange the support
for �My shoes are wet."

Contradictory statements of the form given above are
a result of careless assesm
s ent. of one ·s objections. An
IO'Xample will illustrate this point. We all know that

Probabilitv calculus formalizes irrelevance in terms of
condition�! probability. The statement "A becomes
irrelevant. to B once C is known'' is formalize d as
�The probability of B given C/1.4 equals the probabil­
it.y of B given only C." Formally. irrelevance informa­
tion represented by a PCN can be summarized by a
siugle t>quation. If D(i) conta ins the parents of propo­
sition Pi. and 0( i) contain s its non-descendants. t he n

expert. is us ing Equation 1 to update his state of be­
lief. Specifically, according to Equation 1, b m u st

\Ve also know that. abnormality is an objection t.o the

Although the two statement s above seem plausibl e.
they are in fact cont.ra.di<'t.ory in the wntext of Equa­

TO STATES OF BELIEF

Objection-based causal networks resemble proba­
bilistic causal networks in their structure and be­
havior .
In an objection-based network . a depen­
dency b etwee n nodes is quantified by providing log­

Co nsidering prior and conditional objections that. are

given in Tables 3. it is cle ar that we cannot evaluate
Equation 4 b ec ause we do not have the objections
needed. However. by using irrelevance inform a tion
that. is represented by the network of Figure 1, we
can reduce Eq u atio n 4 to:

Degrees of support in

tificat.ion has forced us to say that. the c aus al de­
pendency from "It rained" to "The grass is wet"
is weaker than the one from "The grass is Wf't''
to "Mv shoes are wet." No such commitment is
enforc�d by objection-based quantification.
