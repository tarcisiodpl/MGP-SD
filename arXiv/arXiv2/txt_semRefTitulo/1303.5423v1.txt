Introduction

This paper describes some results of research on associate
systems: knowledge-based systems that manage their own
task performance to flexibly and adaptively support their
human users in carrying out complex, time-dependent
problem-solving tasks under uncertainty. Our efforts to
develop such systems focus on the development of
problem-solving methods based on well founded principles
of time-bounded rationality [Fehling & Breese, 1990;
Horvitz, 1988; Russell & Wefald, 1991]. The principles
which underlie the approach we shall describe are derived
from decision theory and decision analysis [Raiffa, 1968;
Howard & Matheson, 1984].
We believe that this
principled approach to problem solving can overcome
many of the limitations of traditional expert-system

approaches, particularly in applications where the system
must flexibly and cooperatively share task-performance
with human users.
Conventional expert system approaches suffer from some
critical shortcomings in providing adaptive and
cooperative support to their users. For the most part,
conventional knowledge systems, especially so-called rule­
based systems, support their users with problem-solving
expertise that is encoded in the form of fixed problem
representations and solution methods. The support
provided by such systems breaks down in situations that
are not sufficiently represented, or when the solution
methods do not match the style or perspective of the user.
In addition, knowledge systems are designed with a fixed
commitment to the role played - i.e., the tasks performed by the expert system; there is no ability to cooperatively
adapt the actions of the support system to the situation­
specific needs of its user. Furthermore, conventional
systems suffer from an inability to adapt to the concerns
of a user to the extent that these concerns diverge from
those of the expert whose knowledge is encapsulated.
The source of these shortcomings in conventional
knowledge systems is the failure to recognize the context­
sensitive needs and objectives of the human user. The
user may require any range of support, from an analytical
tool to a domain tutor, but it is the user's preferences
which should drive the system's actions in providing that
support.
We refer to this type of system as an
associate: one which acts flexibly, adaptively, and
cooperatively in support of human problem-solving in
performing complex, time-dependent tasks under
uncertainty.
Our focus in this paper is on the management of task­
sharing between the human user and an associate system.
We will illustrate how a decision analytic framework for
problem solving in an associate system provides the
mechanism for adaptive task sharing under uncertainty.
Preliminary results are presented for an associate system
application dealing with the management of robotic
planetary exploration rovers.

Decision Methods for Adaptive Task-Sharing in Associate Systems

Associate Systems

Associate systems bridge the gap between systems that
perfonn tasks "on-line", in real-time, and with complete
autonomy in initiating and completing tasks, and typical
advisory systems that operate "off-line" in giving advice
to humans who must initiate and complete all primary
task activities.
Advances in associate system
architectures were recently addressed at a DARPA
sponsored conference [Lehner P., 1991]. Two notable
associate system programs discussed at the conference are
,

rhe U.S. Air Force's Pilot's Associate (PA), and the U.S.
Navy's Submarine Operation Automation System
(SOAS).

Uncertainties and situational dependancies of both benefits
and costs must be modeled. The outcome of task­
performance and, the cost of taking those actions,
inc1uding the cost (if any) of making the consultation, all
effect the final outcome achieved by the cooperative
human-associate problem solving system. The estimated
state of th is total system i s used to determine the
comparative utility of the various strategies for task
sharing.
The primary model, rhen, for an associate system is an
integrated dual decision problem: whether or not to
consult the human user prior to taking action, and what
action to take. We represent this model in an influence
diagram [Howard & Matheson, 1984], as shown in Figure

1.

As in any cooperative relationship, both rhe associate
system and the human user make use of their perceptions
of each other's relative strengths and weaknesses. While
humans are good at making judgements from synthesising
large amounts of information, they have a limited capacity
and efficiency for consistently applying principles for
correct problem solving.
Computation systems,
including intelligent systems, are good at following such
normative principles, but their capacity for judgement is
limited to rheir internal knowledge representations and
inference capabilities. Associate systems exploit these
relative strengths by cooperatively focusing on
performance of subtasks involving minimal judgement.
In addition, associate systems exhibit context sensitive

mixed-initiative behavior by adapting the range of
subtasks they perfonn to meet the demands of the current

problem solving context. For example, an associate
system may weighr the costs (e.g. time) versus the
benefits (e.g. validity) of consulting the human user for

Round nodes in the influence diagram represent state

his/her judgement before taking action autonomously.
Alternatives to consult the user or not are evaluated
according to a utility function which expresses the user's
preferences over multiple, possibly competing, task
objectives. Since the decision is made under uncertainty,
maximum expected utility is the criterion for selecting a
decision alternative. This utility-maximizing approach
provides the mechanism for evaluating the costs and
benefits of consulting the human user.
As the preceding example suggests, the key to an
associate system's mixed-initiative behavior is the
adequacy of the consultation decision. This decision must
reflect rhe potential benefirs of attaining the human user's
judgement before complering and executing a plan for
some speci fic course of one or more actions.
Consultation might improve the state of knowledge of the
associate to support planning and execution, increasing
the expected utility of the problem solving actions that are
likely to be undertaken. The decision musr also reflecr rhe
costs of making rhe consultation with the human user.
These costs should re flec t not only resource or

also the costs incurred by the human user as well.

variables whose value is uncertain. Two-circle nodes
represent deterministic functions whose output is purely a
function of the inputs with no additional uncertainty.
Square nodes represent decision variables, and octagons
represent the utility function wh i ch expresses the
preferences of the human user. Arrows between uncertain
nodes represent probabilistic dependencies between the two
variables. Arrows pointing to decision nodes indicate tha t
the state of the node at the tail of the arrow is known
when the decision is made. While a node in an influence
diagram is intended to represent a single state variable,
each node in Figure 1 may be seen as a "super-node"
representing a vector of many state variables.
The World node in Figure 1 represents the uncertain state
of the task environment with which the human-associate
system is interacting. The associate is capable of making
imperfect observations of the world (/, ssocObs) which it
can then use to determine the Situatbn with which it is
dealing. Those observations are known at the time that it
makes the decision whe ther or not to Consult the human
user. Depending on rhe implementation, the human may
also be capable of making direct, but imperfect,
observations of the world (HumanObs), as well as
having access to the observations made by the associate.

Paterson and Fehling

If consulted, the human observations are also used to
determine the situation prior to making a decision on what
Action to take. The Situ ation is modeled as a
deterministic node, since it represents a deterministic
procedure by which the associate will synthesise both the
associate and human observations of the world. Both the
action itself and the state of the world influence the
Outcome of the action, as well as the costs incurred by

taking that action (ActCost). If the human user is
consulted there will be some consultation costs
(ConsCost) which could also be influenced by the state
of the world. The Value of the consult decision together
with the action decision is a function of the outcome of
the action and total costs incurred during consultation with
the human user and the course of action carried out.
The consultation model discussed above is made up of the

H u m a n 0 b s and C ons Cost nodes. It is the
Hum anObs node which captures the consulting benefits

or judgement capabilities of the human user.
Characterizing the possible states and corresponding
conditional probabilities for this node is a significant
knowledge acquisition task which should not be
underestimated.

The Mars Rover Manager's Associate
(MRMA) system

We have designed and implemented a system that
demonstrates management of mixed-initiative behavior in
a Mars Rover Manager's Associate (MRMA). Intended as

part of an unmanned robotic exploratory mission to Mars,
MRMA's role would be to manage a small fleet of semi­

autonomous rovers on the Martian surface. MRMA itself
would be located on a Mars-orbiting communications
satellite serving as the link between the rovers and the
human Rover Manager (RM) at mission control on Earth.
The management of

Mars rovers is an excellent

application for a decision making associate system such as
MRMA. Uncertainties will have serious impact on
virtually every aspect of the mission: environment,
communications, navigation, rover performance, etc.
Important tradeoffs will have to be made between rover
safety (i.e. rover mission lifetime) and the potential gain
of scientific knowledge.
While the rovers themselves could be designed to exhibit
associate behavior, there are several advantages to having a
centralized
intelligent
management
system.
Environmental knowledge bases would be maintained with
MRMA so that each rover could learn from the
experiences of others in the fleet. Integrated planning
solutions for cooperating rovers could also be formulated
by MRMA. While strategic and tactical planning would

be executed by MRMA, only lower level operational
planning would be required of the rovers themselves. By
offloading these functions from the rovers, they would be
smaller and less expensive, with more of them for a given
mass budget for Earth-to-Mars transport.
Thus, an

associate management system would complement the use
of small, i ntelli gent "insect" robots, such as those
developed by Rodney Brooks at MIT.l
Resource management will be a dominant theme in
managing the rover fleet. Various consumables will be

carried on board to carry out scientific experiments.
Sample collection mechanisms as well as the propulsion
system will exhibit significant wear and tear over the
mission lifetime. While the rovers will not have to
manage battery energy as a resource, they will have to
manage time. Current designs for the rovers make use of
radioisotope thermal generators or RTGs as their power
supplies. Once power generation is initiated in the RTGs
they cannot be powered down during periods of inactivity;
the power would be lost, radiated as heat. Therefore, it is
critical that inactivity periods for the rovers are minimized
to make use of their limited mission lifetime (2 to 5 years
for the RTGs). Due to the long time delay for Mars-Earth
communications (10 to 45 minutes round trip, varying
with a period of about 2 years), there is a h igh cost
associated with consulting mission control for human

judgement. This cost is even higher (and more uncertain)
when the time for human analysis of the returned data is
considered.

This time delay constitutes the cost component of the
mission control consultation model. Capturing accurate
expectations of human judgement capabilities for the
consultation model will require characterizing the
performance of mission control personnel in interpreting

rover sensor data. One obvious example of this is visual
scene interpretation. Although the rover will posess

image processing and recognition software, the
performance of current technology in this area is limited.
Knowledge acquisition tests with the human rover

managers would be performed to assemble conditional
probabilities for properly identifying various classes of
surface features. Similar performance characterizations
would be made of the rover hardware/software as well.
Both rover and human performance knowledge bases
would be updated during the course of the mission as both
gain experience.
We now present an example where MRMA must decide
whether or not to consult the human rover manager before
planning a deviation from a rover's nominal path. The
scenario is illustrated in Figure 2.

(FieldDepth and FieldWidth), the path
Deviation, and the range from the rover's present
location to the destination site (SiteRange). The
FieldRocks can be interpreted by both the associate and
the rover manager (AssocVideo and User Video ) to
derive an estimate of the RockSize. The rover's rate
through the field (FieldRate) is a function of the
FieldRocks a n d Traction, while the rate over the
plain (PiainRate) is assumed to be known. The

Figure 2: Rover Path Deviation Scenario
Along its nominal path, the rover has encountered an
obstacle field whose surface characteristics differ from the
clear plain over which it had been traveling. Due to
limited resolution in mapping the Martian surface by
satellite, the depth and width of the field are uncertain.
Prior estimates from satellite maps indicate the field is
strewn with rocks of uncertain size. Depending on the
size of the rocks, the rover may be able to roll or step
over them with little or no change in speed, or it may
have to reduce its speed significantly to move around
them. To minimize the time required for the rover to
reach its next destination site, MRMA must decide how
far the rover should deviate around the field. While
MRMA must use prior estimates on the fields dimensions
from the satellite maps, it can task the rover to process a
far-field visual scene of the obstacle field (since the rover
is currently at the edge). The processed image provides an
improved estimate of rock size. However, MRMA also
has the option of transmitting the visual scene to the
human rover managers at mission control for them to
interpret. Figure 3 shows how we have instantiated the
generic associate system influence diagram (Figure 1) for
this scenario.

location of M a rs in its orbit relative to the Earth
(MarsLoc) is relevant to the consultation delay
(ConsDelay) with the rover manager. In this example,
the utility function is one dimensional, being concerned
only with the TotaiTime required for the rover to get to
the destination site.
It is obvious from our description that a significant level
of knowledge representation is required to assess and
implement the associate system decision model. The
conditional probability distributions for the uncertain
nodes capture prior know1edge about the environment (e.g.
FieldRocks), knowledge of sensor accuracies (e.g.
FieldDepth, FieldWidth), and performance knowledge
of the associate and human user (e.g. AssocVideo,
Tracti o n, U s er V i de o, C ons D elay).
Other
performance knowledge is captured in the deterministic
node functions (e.g. FieldRate, PlainRate).
While many efficient algorithms exist for solving
influence diagrams [Olmsted, 1983; Shachter, 1986],

various types of analyses can be performed on an influence
diagram prior to actual solution. Deterministic sensitivity
analysis and value-of-information calculations are of
particular use to associate systems [Howard, Matheson
1984]. Deterministic sensitivity analysis is used to
evaluate the sensitivity of the value node's utility function

to the various sources of uncertainty in the influence
diagram. For each combination of decision alternatives,
the utility range is determined for each variable by fixing
the remaining variables at their base case values. Ranking
each variable in its contribution to total variance, the
utility ranges for each variable can be plotted in a "tornado
diagram". Figure 4 shows one such tornado diagram for
the influence diagram in Figure 3.

The associate then has the capability to fix uncertain
variables at their base case values if they fall below a
predetermined cumulative variance threshold (e.g. 95%).
Since fixing uncertain variables reduces the combinatorial
complexity of the problem, this analysis aids the associate
in achieving time-bounded rationality. If the human user
is consulted for advice, or if the user is reviewing actions
that the associate has taken autonomously, the tornado
diagram is a useful representation for the user to gain
insight onto the problem itself, and the problem solving
approach of the associate.
For the analysis shown in Figure 4, the FieldRocks
node was shown to be the most sensitive of all the
uncertainties in the model. This is fortunate, since the
AssocVideo and UserVideo nodes provide (imperfect)
information on the state of FieldRocks prior to making
the Deviation decision. Figure 4 also shows a high
sensitivity to FieldWidth .

calculations could be performed to determine the cost (in
time) that the associate/user would be willing to pay for
perfect information on this variable (in terms of the
influence diagram, the increase in utility from adding an

Specifically, we have developed the model of the
consultation decision which the associate uses to infer the
utility of deferring its own action in order to consult the
human user. Our work has also expanded the notion that
intelligent associate systems should employ decision
theoretic computations to guide problem solving by using
such techniques to determine appropriate context-specific
tactics for person-machine, cooperative task sharing.
This research has shown that the methods of rational
decision making are central to associate system design.
While these decision methods constitute a normative
model of problem-solving, we believe the concept and
implementation of the consultation model for associates
seeking support from humans is very similar to the
process humans use when contemplating the use of
software tools in time or resource constrained situations.
Finally, our work with MRMA has led to the design and
application of new software tools and architectures for
implementing decision theoretic principles in associate
systems.

management of complex, distributed production processes,
and in the development of an insuuctable robot.

MRMA is currently implemented both in HyperCard on a
Macintosh II, and using CLOS in Macintosh Common
Lisp (MCL). While the HyperCard implementation uses
conventional discrete probability distributions and discrete
decision alternatives, the MCL implementation uses a
linear-quadratic-Gaussian model with multivariate normal
distributions [Shachter & Kenley, 1989].

We are exploring new knowledge representation techniques
that are better suited for use in an associate system's
decision making and action control processes. These
knowledge representation techniques support uniform
representation of uncertain causal, taxonomic, and
temporal relations among events, objects, and process
concepts. We are also developing methods for dynamic
model construction [Fehling & Johnson, 1991] that allow

the influence diagram shown in Figure 3 to include a third
decision node to examine the alternative of waiting for the
next mapping satellite pass for an improved estimate on
the distribution of FiefdWidth.

Analysis and Review

Our research with MRMA is helping us to formulate and
implement problem solving capabilities required in
associate systems and to demonstrate their value in
performing complex time-bounded tasks under uncertainty.
While other research efforts have shown the effectiveness
of decision theoretic approaches for adaptive, automated
problem-solving under uncertainty [Fehling & Breese,
1990; Horvitz, 1988; Russell & Wefald, 1991], our
efforts on MRMA have clarifiied several issues in the
