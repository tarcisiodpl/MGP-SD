Influence Diagram Transformations

The arc reversal operation transforms one PID into
another with a different ordered list. In the process,
extra arcs often must be added to the PID. However,in
transforming to and from DPID's, we can guarantee
limits on the addition of those extra arcs.
The arc reversal operation transforms a PID by changing
the direction of one of the arcs [Olmsted, 1983;
Shachter, 1986]. Afterwards, each of the two nodes
inherits their common parents. The operation can be
interpreted as momentarily merging the two nodes and
then splitting them apart. The arc (i, j) is reversible if
it is the only directed path from i to j. Otherwise, a
directed cycle would be created by reversing the arc. The
general case for arc reversal is shown in Figure 2, in
which the arc (i,j) is reversed. Afterwards,A,B, and C
are parents for both i and j.

Figure 2. General Arc Reversal Operation.

Given a target ordered list and any PID, we can
transform the PID into another PID consistent with the
minimal DPID, using only arc reversal operations
[Chyu, 1990b; Shachter, 1990]. The algorithm
involves visiting each node j in the reverse target order:
reverse all arcs to j's successors which come before it in
the target order. Arcs must be reversed in the order they
appear in the current PID. but when there is a choice,

Given a PID and a target ordered list, a new PID
consistent with the corresponding minimal DPID can
be obtained through a sequence of arc reversals.

frQQt

The proof is by induction as we visit each node k in
the reverse target order. We have two induction
hypotheses: the current PID contains no arcs outside
of the target DPID and the target list after k is an
ordered list for the current PID.
To prove the theorem we must show that all of the
arcs reversed are reversible, and that the induction
hypotheses are maintained.

First, we show that the target list starting with k will
be ordered for the current PID. This follows,because
we reverse any arcs from k to successors which
precede it in the ordered list, and all of the other nodes
which follow k are already in the target order.
Second, we show that any arc (k, j) to be reversed is
indeed reversible. If this were not true, then there
must be some node i, k � i � j. If i belongs before
k then (k, i) would have been reversed before (k, j).
Therefore i must belong after k, but it is not properly
ordered since it precedes j. Thus we contradict the
induction hypotheses and it must be true that arc (k,
j) is reversible.
Finally,we must show that no arcs are created outside
of the target DPID. A new arc is created when we
reverse arc (k,j) only if there is some node i..%: which
is a parent of k or j and not of the other. Since all
nodes following k are in their target order, k must
follow both i and j in the target order. Now all
current arcs are by induction in the target chordal
graph, so this new arc is required for the target
#
ordering to be perfect
As a special case of this result, we can transform
between any two DPID's which have the same moral
graph,and hence correspond to the same chordal graph
[Chyu, 1990b; Smith, 1989].

Because the choice of chordal graph is arbitrary, we can

244

In the directed representation, an important property is
that of a deterministic function, a variable whose
outcome is known with certainty given its parents'
outcomes. This introduces additional conditional
independence into the diagram which can be exploited
during evidence propagation. At the same, when the
PID is only being used to obtain posterior marginal
distributions for a subset of variables or with limited
observations, then the PID can be preprocessed to
eliminate variables that are irrelevant for the desired
results [Geiger et al., 1989; Shachter, 1988; Shachter,
1990]. This elimination can be performed on the
working PID or, if possible, before the target DPID is
determined.
Another promising hybrid might exploit the impressive
speed and simplicity of the HUG IN undirected method
[Andersen et al., 1989; Jensen et al., 1990a; Jensen et
al., 1990b] by maintaining joint distributions for a node
and its parents instead of conditional distributions. This
simplifies the operation of arc reversal, but does require
maintaining the full DPID instead of simply a PID
consistent with it. There are a couple of advantages to
using this method on undirected graphs which appear
applicable to directed methods as well. These
advantages are symmetric operations for evidence and
probability propagation and the recognition of zeros in
the sparse joint distribution matrices.
