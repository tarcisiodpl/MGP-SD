Introduction

the more general case of multiple hypotheses can be
represented by adding additional hypothesis nodes.

The nature and timing of actions by decision mak­
ers is often influenced by the pressures generated by
time-dependent processes. We will examine the oppor­
tunity to minimize effort expended on modeling com­
plex probabilistic dependencies over time by shifting
attention to the definition and direct assessment of
states that summarize important outcomes at future
times. After touching on the general problem of plan­
ning and action in time-critical contexts, we introduce
a set of time-critical decision problems and represen­
tational simplifications with the goal of bypassing the
handling of complex probabilistic dependencies over
time.

Finally, we will highlight the ideas in the con­

text of the real-world domain of time-critical medicine.

2.1

Temporal Processes and Sequences of
Actions

Let us now consider the problem of multiple actions
and outcomes taken over time.

In the general case,

we must consider the expected utility of outcomes in­
fluenced by different sequences of actions.

Figure 2

displays an influence diagram for a set of actions over
time. Rather than considering actions and value in an
atemporal or only implicitly temporal context, we now
index actions, observations, and states of the world by
time. As indicated in Figure 2, we seek to generate an
ideal sequence of actions or plan over time that max­
imizes expected utility, given background knowledge

lighted in this figure. We represent in the model the
notion that the utility of outcomes is influenced by
the state of a system or the world at some t ime in the
future. Also, this prototypical model represents the
common situation that the states of the world at time
t often influence states of the world at timet+ 1, cap­
turing the notion that the current state of a system has
influence on future states Many processes that show
fluidity of change in variables of a system can be rep­
resented by this type of Markov dependency. Laying
at the foundation of such evolving dependent physical
processes is a combination of persistence in the overall
structu ra l fabric of objects and of ongoing temporal
influences; we typically take for granted such stability
and temporal influence in a large battery of physical
processes that we encounter daily.
.

As indicated by the dependencies between actions and
states, actions can directly influence states at increas­
ingly later periods of time depending on the temporal
properties of the action and states of the world. Also,
observations that are available in the present moment,
t0, may have been caused or influenced directly by
states existing at previous times. Such temporal de­
lays in the response to action and in the emitting of
evidence can lead to a variety of challenging modeling
problems. For example, in many cases, we know that
the evidence we are seeing in the present are caused by
states of the system in earlier periods. As an example,
the m odeling and assessment for the Vista decision­
theoretic monitoring application that has been used
at NASA Mission Control Center [7], took into con­
sideration the expected delay induced by the process
of processing and beaming to earth telemetry from the
Space Shuttle.
In work on Markov decision processes, utility is often
computed for sequences of states as a function of re­
wards assigned to individual states reached by a deci­
sion making agent [12, 14, 17]. In a variety of decision
contexts it can be difficult to structure the problem
to represent value as rewards on intermediate states.
Rather, it can be most appropriate and efficient to as­
se ss the utility over specific critical states as the value

Time-Critical

Timely action is often critical in facing real world chal­
lenges. Time-critical contexts are situations where the
expected value of an outcome is diminished as some
function of the delay of taking one or more actions
available to a decision maker or decision making sys­
tem. Real-world, time-critical decision problems are
typically cast in the context of an acute challenge or
opportunity which heralds the initiation of a decision
context. Challenges include a variety of processes and
influences that can threaten valued stability or equi­
libria in a system, or that reduce quantities of a valued
commodity. Opportunities include the development of
situations that are associated with new possibilities or
means to achieve a desired state of affairs.
Representations of time-dependent probability and
utility have been discussed in several communities.
There has been g rowing interest in time-dependent
utility in planning [1, 5] and automated decision
making [9]. Decision analysts working in such ar­
eas as medical decision making have considered time­
dependent probability and utility in building models
for consultation on time-pressured decisions (e.g., see
[15]). A variety of formal models of urgency and their
relationships to the value of computation is explored
in [11]. The consideration of Bayesian models con­
taining explicit temporal dependencies has been ex­
plored in detail by Dagum, et al. [2]. More recently,
researchers have been exploring a variety of methods
for efficiently solving such temporal Bayesian models
[13]. Finally, there is a rich literature exploring the
consideration of time-dependent processes in partially
observable Markov decision processes.

We can gracefully introduce additional complexity into

Figure 4: Direct assessment of time-dependent utility.
In some cases, it can be useful to formulate the task of

mary outcome. For example, the utility associated
with outcomes of pathological processes in propulsion
systems that are used to guide the Space Shuttle can
be assessed as the value of the ultimate short-term
outcome, following a set of firing and system control
actions, which lead to a new trajectory of the Shuttle
and to potential damage to systems that can provide
future propulsion actions [7].
For the fixed horizon or the indicator models, it can
be useful to assess outcomes directly in terms of the
utilities of the states of interest. As highlighted by the
model in Figure 4, rather than assessing and encod­
ing potentially complex intermediate time-dependent
changes in the probability of a system given differ­
ent actions and duration of the pathological process,
we summarize outcomes by assessing a time-dependent
utility, u(A, H, t) as a function of the action taken, the
state of the system, and the duration t of the patho­
logical process. Such direct assessment was explored
in building the NASA Vista system for providing de­
cision support for ground controllers about the best
way to react to complex telemetry. Time-dependent
utility was assessed as parameterized functions of the
state, action, and duration of the process. We found
that performing such a reformulation of the assessment
task can ease the burden of modeling and assessing de­
tails of time-dependent probabilities.

where p(Hj IE,�) is the probability of processes H,

�. Note that, as the system we are monitoring and
attempting to control is evolving in time, the best ac­
tion at time t, A* (t), is not necessarily equal to the
best action A" (t') at a later timet'.
In assessing time-dependent utility, we can often sum­
marize the variation in the utility over a large set of
outcomes as a function of the duration of a process
with parameterized functions that capture the basic
structure of the cost of time. Prototypical cost func­
tions include urgency, deadline, uncertain deadline,
and several variants of cost built as combinations of
these cost functions [10]. Such prototypical cost func­
tions are recurrent in many real-world applications and
arise in common interactions such as lost opportunity
and competition for limited resources. The urgency
context refers to the class of utility functions that as­
sign cost or diminishment of value as some monoton­
ically increasing function of delay. The deadline con­
text refers to cases where cost is zero or negligible until
some value of delay is reached, at which time a signif­
icant cost is incurred. The uncertain deadline is the
common situation of facing a uncertain deadline, rep­
resented as a probability distribution over a deadline.
4.1

Characterizing Losses with Delay

We can characterize the cost of delay in a decision con­
text with the expected cost of delayed action ( ECDA).
The ECDA is the difference in expected value of tak­
ing immediate ideal action, at time t0, and delaying
ideal corrective action until time t,

Expected Cost of Delayed Action

A useful measure for modeling and assessing outcomes
is the expected cost of delayed action. The principle
of maximum expected utility, dictated by the axioms
of utility, specifies that a decision maker should take
actions with the greatest expected utility. In time­
critical contexts, the utility of the outcomes of action
are a function of the actions and the time at which
they are taken. We shall use u(A;,Hj, t) to represent
the time-dependent utility of outcomes of actions A in
the context of time-dependent processes H. We can

We can compute the ECDA for any two moments in
time, t0 and t. We typically take t0 to be the present
moment and compute the ECDA for delays in action
until timet.
Variants of the ECDA measure have been used in ear­
lier decision support systems. The measure was first
developed for prioritizing the display of information
in the Vista-I system [8]. Beyond using the cost of
delayed action for prioritizing the display of possible
faults, Vista research also experimented with the dis­
play of an overall measure of criticality of a decision
