We propose a new method for parameter
learning in Bayesian networks with qualitative influences. This method extends our previous work from networks of binary variables
to networks of discrete variables with ordered
values. The specified qualitative influences
correspond to certain order restrictions on
the parameters in the network. These parameters may therefore be estimated using
constrained maximum likelihood estimation.
We propose an alternative method, based
on the isotonic regression. The constrained
maximum likelihood estimates are fairly complicated to compute, whereas computation
of the isotonic regression estimates only requires the repeated application of the Pool
Adjacent Violators algorithm for linear orders. Therefore, the isotonic regression estimator is to be preferred from the viewpoint of
computational complexity. Through experiments on simulated and real data, we show
that the new learning method is competitive
in performance to the constrained maximum
likelihood estimator, and that both estimators improve on the standard estimator.

Introduction

In recent work, Wittig and Jameson (2000), Altendorf,
Restificar, and Dietterich (2005) and Feelders and
van der Gaag (2005) have shown that the use of qualitative influences can improve the probability estimates
in Bayesian networks, in case relatively few observations are available. Feelders and van der Gaag (2005)
provide a simple algorithm, based on the isotonic regression, that is however restricted to binary variables.
On the other hand, the approaches of Wittig and
Jameson (2000), and Altendorf, Restificar, and Diet-

terich (2005) can handle non-binary variables as well,
but require a numeric optimization algorithm to compute the estimates. Apart from improvement of the
parameter estimates, Wittig and Jameson (2000) and
Feelders and van der Gaag (2005) argue that networks
with probability estimates that reflect the qualitative
knowledge specified by the domain experts are less
likely to exhibit counterintuitive reasoning behaviour
and are therefore more likely to be accepted.
In this paper, we propose an alternative orderrestricted estimator for discrete variables with ordered
values. This estimator is easy to compute, and, as
our experiments show, performs quite well compared
to the order-restricted maximum likelihood estimator. We note that the work discussed in Niculescu,
Mitchell, and Rao (2006) and Niculescu, Mitchell, and
Rao (2007) on Bayesian network learning with parameter constraints, does not cover the type of parameter
constraints resulting from qualitative influences, and
can therefore be seen as complementary to the work
presented here.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we
introduce the required notation that will be used
throughout the paper. In section 3 we describe the
proposed parameter learning method. In section 4
we discuss an algorithm for order-restricted maximum
likelihood estimation due to Hoff (2003). This algorithm is of interest in its own right, and is used in
our experiments for comparison with the proposed alternative estimator. Section 5 reports on experiments
with real and artificial data sets. Finally, section 6
concludes.

Preliminaries

We consider a node Y , with parents X = X1 , . . . , Xk .
Let Y = {1, 2, . . . , dy } denote the set of dy possible
values of Y . We assume the values of Y are linearly
ordered, with the obvious ordering. Likewise, Xi =
{1, 2, . . . , di } denotes the set of di possible values of

118

FEELDERS

Xi . The values of Xi are again assumed to be linearly
ordered, with the obvious ordering. Furthermore, let
X = ×ki=1 Xi denote the set of all parent configurations
of Y .
+

A parent Xi has a positive influence on Y (Xi −→ Y )
if for all xi , x0i ∈ Xi :
xi ≤ x0i ⇒ P (Y |xi , x−i )  P (Y |x0i , x−i )

(1)

where x−i is any configuration of the parents of Y
other than Xi (Wellman 1990). Here P (Y |xi , x−i ) 
P (Y |x0i , x−i ) means that the distribution of Y for
parent configuration (xi , x−i ) is stochastically smaller
than for parent configuration (x0i , x−i ), that is
F (y|xi , x−i ) ≥ F (y|x0i , x−i ),

y = 1, 2, . . . , dy

where F (y) = P (Y ≤ y). In words: for the smaller
value of Xi , smaller values of Y are more likely. A
negative qualitative influence is defined analogously,
where for larger values of Xi smaller values of Y are
more likely. Without loss of generality, we henceforth
assume that all influences are positive. A negative
influence from Xi to Y can be made positive simply
by reordering the values in Xi .
In the sequel, it will be convenient to impose the ordering specified in (1) on the parent configurations,
together with the rule that
∀x, x0 ∈ X : x  x0 ⇒ P (Y |x)  P (Y |x0 ),
where the order on X is the product order
x  x0 ≡ ∀i = 1, . . . , k : xi ≤ x0i

3

The isotonic regression estimator

Before we start the discussion of our proposed estimator, we note that qualitative influences only impose
constraints between the parameters (conditional probabilities) associated with the different parent configurations of a variable, but the parameters associated
with different variables are still unrelated. Hence, we
can in the sequel restrict our attention to the parameters associated with a single variable.
Recall that the qualitative influences impose a partial
order  on X . Any real-valued function f on X is isotonic with respect to  if, for any x, x0 ∈ X , x  x0 implies f (x) ≤ f (x0 ). Likewise, any real-valued function
f is antitonic with respect to  if, for any x, x0 ∈ X ,
x  x0 implies f (x) ≥ f (x0 ). Given real-valued numbers g(x) and positive weights w(x), a function g ∗ is
an isotonic (antitonic) regression of g with respect to
the weight function w and partial order , if and only
if it minimizes the sum
X
w(x) [f (x) − g(x)]2
x∈X

within the class of isotonic (antitonic) functions f on
X . The existence of a unique g ∗ has been proven by
Brunk (1965).
P
Let F̂ (y|x) = y0 ≤y P̂ (y 0 |x) denote the unconstrained
MLE of F (y|x), x ∈ X , and let n(x) denote the number of observations with parent configuration x.
Definition 1 (Isotonic regression estimator)
The isotonic regression estimator
F̂ ∗ (y|x),

y = 1, 2, . . . , dy ; x ∈ X

for partial stochastic order, is given by the antitonic
regression of g(x) = F̂ (y|x) with weights w(x) = n(x),
for each value y = 1, 2, . . . , dy .
This estimator is an extension of one proposed for linear orders already by Hogg (1965), and later analyzed
by El Barmi and Mukerjee (2005).
It is not hard to verify that this estimator satisfies
the order constraints by construction. Also, it is an
intuitively plausible estimator, since it returns the estimates with minimum weighted squared distance to
the observed cumulative relative frequencies, that satisfy the constraints. For binary variable Y , the proposed estimator coincides with the constrained maximum likelihood estimator, but this is no longer the
case if Y can take on more than two values.
One should verify whether F̂ ∗ (Y |x) is indeed a valid
distribution function, as required. Hence, we have to
check two properties:
1. ∀y ∈ Y : 0 ≤ F̂ ∗ (y|x) ≤ 1.
2. y ≥ y 0 ⇒ F̂ ∗ (y|x) ≥ F̂ ∗ (y 0 |x).
Both follow almost immediately from well-known
properties of the isotonic regression. To show this,
we require some additional definitions. A subset L of
X is a lower set of X with respect to , if x ∈ L,
x0 ∈ X , and x0  x imply x0 ∈ L. Hence, if a lower
set contains a particular element, it is required to also
contain all lower ordered elements. Likewise, a subset
U of X is an upper set of X if x ∈ U , x0 ∈ X , and
x  x0 imply x0 ∈ U . The weighted average of g, with
weights w, for a nonempty subset A of X is defined as
P
x∈A w(x)g(x)
Av(A) = P
x∈A w(x)
Now, the antitonic regression can be characterized as
follows (Robertson, Wright, and Dykstra 1988):
g ∗ (x) = max min Av(L ∩ U )
L:x∈L U :x∈U

(2)

FEELDERS
From (2) we can see that F̂ ∗ (y|x) is a weighted average of observed relative frequencies, so it follows
that 0 ≤ F̂ ∗ (y|x) ≤ 1. Also, since we have that
F̂ (y|x) ≥ F̂ (y 0 |x) for y ≥ y 0 , it follows that its
weighted average is larger for every set A. Hence, it
follows from (2) that F̂ ∗ (y|x) ≥ F̂ ∗ (y 0 |x), as required.
Next, we turn to the computation of the estimator.
Let N denote the number of elements of X . The best
time complexity known for an exact solution to the
isotonic regression problem for arbitrary partial order on X is O(N 4 ) (Maxwell and Muchstadt 1985),
so the time complexity for computing the proposed
estimator using this algorithm is O(dy N 4 ). Dykstra
and Robertson (1982), however, propose an efficient
iterative algorithm for product partial orders. This algorithm is very simple to implement, because it only
requires the repeated application of the Pool Adjacent
Violators (PAV) algorithm for linear orders. The PAV
algorithm runs in linear time (Ahuja and Orlin 2001).
The pseudo-code for the product order algorithm of
Dykstra and Robertson (1982) is given below. It takes
as input numbers g(x) and weights w(x), x ∈ X to be
made isotonic with respect to the product order on X .
IRProductOrder(g(x), w(x))
For each j ∈ {1, . . . , k} and x ∈ X do
Ij (x) ← 0
Repeat
For each j ∈ {1, . . . , k} do
For each x ∈ X do P
gj (x) ← g(x) + i6=j Ii (x)
For each x−j ∈ X−j do
ĝj (x−j , Xj = 1), . . . , ĝj (x−j , Xj = dj ) ←
PAV(gj (x−j , Xj = 1), . . . , gj (x−j , Xj = dj ),
w(x−j , Xj = 1), . . . , w(x−j , Xj = dj ))
For each x ∈ X do
Ij (x) ← ĝj (x) − gj (x)
Until converged
Return ĝ(x)

For each parent Xj , and each configuration x−j of the
remaining parents the algorithm performs the isotonic
regression on the vector
gj (x−j , Xj = 1), . . . , gj (x−j , Xj = dj ),
where (x−j , Xj = xj ) denotes the parent configuration with X−j = x−j and Xj = xj . This set of parent
configurations has linear order, so the PAV algorithm
can be applied to make the vector decreasing (recall
we require the antitonic rather than the isotonic regression). The numbers gj (x) are obtained by adding
the “increments” Ii (x), i 6= j from the other parents
to g(x). Dykstra and Robertson (1982) prove that the
ĝj , j = 1, 2, . . . , k all converge to the isotonic regression g ∗ . To compute the parameter estimates, this algorithm is called with g(x) = F̂ (y|x) and w(x) = n(x)
for each value of Y .

119

Since there are k parents, and the number of values
of parent j is dj , the number of operations within the
repeat loop can be computed Q
as follows. To process
parent j we have to perform i6=j di isotonic regressions on dj distinct values. Each isotonic regression
can be computed in O(dj ) steps, so to process parent j we have to perform O(N ) operations. Since we
have to do this for each parent, each repeat cycle takes
O(kN ) operations.

4

Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The constrained maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by maximizing
XX
L=
n(y, x) log P (y|x)
x∈X y∈Y

subject to: x  x0 ⇒ P (Y |x)  P (Y |x0 ), and where
n(y, x) denotes the number of cases with parent configuration x and Y = y.
Altendorf, Restificar, and Dietterich (2005) translate
the order constraints into penalty terms in the objective function, and use a BFGS-type algorithm to optimize the penalized log-likelihood function. Their algorithm may converge outside the feasible region, in
which case the penalty weight is increased and the optimization is performed anew. They mention more efficient and reliable optimization methods as a point
for further research. Dykstra and Feltz (1989) give
an algorithm for computing the constrained maximum
likelihood estimates, but this algorithm is quite complicated. For running our experiments, we have chosen
an algorithm proposed by Hoff (2003). This algorithm
is very easy to implement, and will produce the constrained maximum likelihood estimates like the algorithm of Dykstra and Feltz (1989).
The algorithm of Hoff (2003) is based on the following observations. Recall that the goal is to estimate a
collection of distributions (one for each parent configuration) subject to stochastic order constraints. The
set of all collections satisfying these constraints is a
convex set, that is, if we take a convex combination of
any two collections satisfying the constraints, then the
resulting collection will satisfy the constraints as well.
Note furthermore that each element of a convex set
can be written as a convex combination of its extreme
elements. As Hoff (2003) shows, an extreme element
corresponds to a collection of point-mass distributions
that satisfies the constraints. From these observations
it follows that we can view the estimation problem
currently under consideration, as one of estimating
the mixing proportions of a finite mixture model, with
known components. Application of the EM-algorithm
to the problem of estimating the mixture proportions

120

FEELDERS

of a finite mixture model, where the component densities of the mixture are completely specified, is wellknown and relatively straightforward (see for example
(McLachlan and Krishnan 1997), section 1.4.3). Note
however, that in the case under consideration, each
component of the mixture is a collection of distributions. Hence, we can write
∀x ∈ X : P (Y |x) =

c
X

πi Pi (Y |x)

i=1

where π = (π1 , . . . , πc ) is the vector of unknown mixing proportions, and {Pi (Y |x), x ∈ X } is the collection
of distributions, one for each parent configuration x,
corresponding to extreme element i.
Now, let D = {(y1 , x1 ), . . . , (yn , xn )} represent the observed data, and let zij = 1 if yj , with parent configuration xj , originates from component i, and zij = 0
otherwise. If zij were observed, then the MLE of πi
would simply be given by (McLachlan and Krishnan
1997)
n
X
π̂i =
zij /n (i = 1, . . . , c),
j=1

that is, the proportion of the sample originating from
the ith component of the mixture. The EM scheme
to estimate πi is given by (McLachlan and Krishnan
1997)
n

(t+1)
(t)
πi

for i = 1, . . . , c, where zij is the posterior probability
that yj , with parent configuration xj , originates from
the ith component of the mixture, based on the current
estimate π (t) of the mixing proportions, that is
(t)

(t)

zij = Pc

πi Pi (yj |xj )

(t)
k=1 πk Pk (yj |xj )

,

for i = 1, . . . , c; j = 1, . . . , n.
Finally, we turn to the issue of enumerating the mixture components, or extreme elements. We denote the
N distinct parent configurations by x1 , . . . , xN . Recall that each extreme element is a collection of pointmass distributions that satisfies the order constraints.
Hence, the set of extreme points S is given by
S = {(s1 , . . . , sN ), sk ∈ Y : xi  xj ⇒ si ≤ sj },
where sk = y indicates that P (Y |xk ) has point mass
on Y = y. If we number the elements of S as s1 , . . . , sc ,
then we can write
P (Y = y|X = xj ) =

c
X
k=1

I(skj = y)πk ,

(3)

where skj denotes the jth component of extreme element sk , and I(·) is the indicator function of the truth
of its argument. Hence, after convergence of the EM(t)
algorithm, the final values πk can be plugged into (3)
to obtain the required conditional distributions.
Although the mixture approach turns a fairly complex constrained optimization problem into a relative
straightforward unconstrained optimization problem,
it has the drawback that the number of extreme points
grows very fast with the number of parent configurations and the number of elements of Y. If we consider
a ternary variable, with ternary parents, then for one
parent the number of extreme points is 10, for two parents it’s 175 and for three parents it’s 211,250. Therefore this algorithm can unfortunately only be applied
to small problems. Nevertheless, since it suffices for
our purposes, we have used it to perform the experimental comparison with the isotonic regression estimator.

Experimental Comparison

In this section we report on experiments with the different parameter learning algorithms: the isotonic regression estimator (ISO), the constrained maximum
likelihood estimator (CML), and the unconstrained
maximum likelihood or standard estimator (STAND).
We generated data from a known distribution, computed the different estimators, and compared the fitted distributions with the generating distribution. The
similarity between the true and fitted distribution was
measured by their Hellinger distance DH :
DH (P, Q) =

2
X p
p
P (y) − Q(y)
y

To generate the data we specified the conditional distribution of Y for each parent configuration, and drew
a sample of some fixed size (ranging from 5 to 100)
from each of the distributions. The Hellinger distance between the true and fitted distributions was
then computed for each conditional distribution and
summed.
We first checked whether the standard estimator already satisfied the order constraints, because in that
case both order-constrained estimators coincide with
the standard estimator. This also allowed us to verify
how often there were order reversals in the standard
estimator for different distributions and sample sizes.
We first generated data from the distribution depicted
in Figure 1. This figure contains all parent configurations for two ternary parents. The arrows indicate the
direct precedence relations, imposed by two positive
influences, between parent configurations. Below each

FEELDERS
“layer” of incomparable parent configurations the distribution of the ternary child variable is specified by
giving P (Y ≤ 1) and P (Y ≤ 2). This representation is
convenient for verifying whether the order constraints
are satisfied. Within each layer, the distributions are
identical.

it appears the isotonic regression is somewhat better
than constrained ML for small sample size, in terms
of Hellinger distance.
In order to see what happens when the specified constraints are incorrect, we generated data from the distribution in Figure 1 “reversed”, that is the layer 1
distribution was assigned to layer 5, layer 2 was assigned to layer 4, etc. Hence, this corresponds to the
rather extreme situation that the expert specified two
positive influences, when in fact there are two negative
influences.

The results are displayed in Figure 2. This figure
shows the Hellinger distance to the true conditional
distributions for the different estimators. These distances were added over all nine parent configurations
(conditional distributions) and averaged over 100 replications of the experiment. The sample sizes indicated
on the x-axis are per parent configuration; for example n = 5 means 5 observations per parent configuration, and hence a total sample size of 45 in this
case. The figure shows that both constrained estimators perform better than the standard estimator for
small sample sizes. As the sample size grows, all three
errors become small and almost the same. In this case,

The results are shown in Figure 3. At first sight they
seem very surprising: the constrained estimators are
still better than the standard estimator, and the error
for small sample sizes even appears to be smaller than
in the case with correct constraints. The explanation
for this is that the constrained estimators benefit from
a “smoothing” or “shrinking” effect. This can most
clearly be seen for the isotonic regression estimator:
order reversals of the standard estimates are removed
by averaging them over blocks of “contiguous” parameters; see equation (2). If the constraints applied are
exactly the opposite of those actually present in the
true distribution, there will be many order reversals
in the sample, and hence a lot of averaging to remove
these reversals.
In an attempt to correct for this smoothing effect, we
applied the Laplace correction for the standard estimator, replaced the constrained ML by the MAP estimator with a prior count of 1 in each cell, and performed
the isotonic regression on the Laplace corrected standard estimates. The results are displayed in Figure 4

122

n = 100 when the constraints are correct. Nevertheless, Figure 5 shows that for n = 5, 10 there is still
some benefit from the additional smoothing, on top of
the Laplace correction, due to enforcing the incorrect
constraints.

We can draw a number of conclusions from these results. Firstly, if we compare Figure 2 with Figure 4,
we see that smoothing reduces the error of the estimates for the smaller sample sizes. If we compare
Figure 4 with Figure 5, we see that the constrained
estimates still give some improvement when the applied constraints are incorrect, but this improvement
has now become smaller than when the constraints are
correct. With incorrect constraints, the standard estimates already have lower error than constrained ML at
n = 20, whereas the constrained estimates have somewhat lower error than the standard estimates even at

Figure 7: Results for distribution displayed in figure 6,
with smoothing.
We performed the same experiments with the probabilities depicted in Figure 6. Here we specified larger
margins between the values of contiguous parameters
in the ordering. In other words, the positive influences
in Figure 6 are stronger than in Figure 1. The results
(with smoothing) are depicted in Figure 7 (constraints
correct) and Figure 8 (constraints incorrect). In Figure 7 we see that the constrained ML estimator performs slightly better here than the isotonic regression
estimator. From Figure 8 we conclude that with the
large margin between the values of contiguous parameters, and incorrect constraints, the standard estimator
is superior also for small sample size.

In addition to the analysis on simulated data, we also
performed a number of experiments on real data sets.
We selected two examples where positive influences between parent and child are plausible. Like with the
simulated data, we only considered one variable and
its parents at a time. The experimental setup was
as follows. We drew random samples of size 20, 50
and 100 from the data, and used this sample for estimating the parameters. For the standard estimate
we performed the Laplace correction, the isotonic regression was performed on these “smoothed” standard
estimates, and the reported constrained ML estimates
are actually MAP estimates with a prior count of 1
in each cell. Then we computed the log-loss of each
estimator on the remaining data as follows:
Pntest
− i=1 log P̂ (yi |xi )
Ltest =
,
ntest
where ntest is the number of observations in the test
set. This whole procedure was again replicated 100
times.
The first data set we analyzed is Windsor Housing
(Koop 2000). This data set contains the selling price
of 546 houses near Windsor (Canada), together with
a number of attributes of these houses. For many of
these attributes it is plausible that they have a positive relation with the selling price. We selected the
lot size and number of bedrooms as parents of selling
price. The selling price was discretized into four levels,
using the quartiles of the empirical distribution. Parent variables were subsequently discretized with the
algorithm of Fayyad and Irani (1993). This resulted
in three levels for lot size, and two levels for number
of bedrooms.

Table 2: Average log-loss ± standard error, of the different estimators on Pima Indians data.

The results are presented in Table 1. We read from
the table that constrained maximum likelihood (CML)
and isotonic regression (ISO) perform somewhat better than the standard estimator (STAND) on the test
data for small training samples. We conclude from the
reported standard errors however, that the observed
improvements are not significant. The performance of
CML and ISO is seen to be virtually identical.
The same basic observations hold for a second example, where we use the Pima Indians data from the UCI
machine learning repository (Blake and Merz 1998).
The example is a fragment from the network specified
by Altendorf, Restificar, and Dietterich (2005). The
body-mass index is the child variable, and age, number of pregnancies and perceived risk due to pedigree
are its parents, all with a positive influence. The bodymass index was discretized into three equal-frequency
bins, and the parents were again discretized using the
algorithm of Fayyad and Irani (1993). This resulted
in three binary parents. The results are reported in
Table 2.
Note that even for n = 100, the standard estimates
have order reversals on all training samples. Computation of the standard estimates reveals that one of
the specified order constraints (the positive influence
of number of pregnancies) is violated on the complete
data set.

Summary and Conclusions

We have presented a new method for learning the parameters of Bayesian networks with prior knowledge
of qualitative influences. We experimentally compared
its performance to that of constrained maximum likelihood estimation and standard (unconstrained) estimation. The results on simulated data show that our
isotonic regression estimator has performance comparable to that of the constrained ML estimator, and
that both perform better than the standard estimator
for relatively small sample sizes. A similar observation
holds for the results on real data, although the performance improvement, in terms of log-loss, could not be
shown to be significant.
The constrained maximum likelihood estimates are
fairly complicated to compute, whereas computation
of the isotonic regression estimates only requires the
repeated application of the PAV algorithm for linear
orders. Therefore, the isotonic regression estimator is
to be preferred from the viewpoint of computational
complexity.
