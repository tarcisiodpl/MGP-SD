Scientists often use directed acyclic graphs (dags) to
model the qualitative structure of causal theories, al­
lowing the parameters to be estimated from observa­
tional data. Two causal models are equivalent if there
is no expirement which could distinguish one from the
other. A canonical representation for causal models
is presented which yields an efficient graphical crite­
rion for deciding equivalence, and provides a theoret­
ical basis for extracting causal structures from em­
pirical data. This representation is then extended to
the more general case of an embedded causal model,
that is, a dag in which only a subset of the variables are observable. The canonical representation

Introduction

The use of dags as a language for describing causal
models has been popular in the behavioral sciences
[Blalock 71], [Duncan 75] and [Wright 34], decision
analysis [Howard and Matheson 81], [Olmsted 84]
and [Shachter 85] and evidential reasoning [Pearl 88],
and has also received extensive theoretical stud­
ies [Geiger and Pearl 89], [Geiger and Verma 90],
[Pearl and Verma 87],
[Glymour et al 1987],
[Shachter 85], [Smith 89], [Spirtes et al 90] and

Figure 1: Three of the four models are equivalent.
For example, consider the four causal models of
Figure 1. The parameters required for the first model
are P(a), P(bla) and P(clb). The second requires
estimations for P(b), P(alb) and P(clb). It is easy
to see that these two models are equivalent since by
Bayes law, P(a)P(bla) = P(ab) = P(b)P(bla), hence
the values obtained for the first set of parameters
completely determine the values of the second, and
vice versa. Similarly, the third model is equivalent to

the first two since its parameters, P(c), P(blc) and
P (a l b) can be determined from either of the first two
sets. However, the fourth model is quite different; its
parameters are P(a), P(c) and P(blac) which cannot
be determined from any of the previous sets.

eralize to embedded causal models.
Embedded causal models are useful for modeling
theories that cannot be modeled via simple dags.
For example, if there are unobserved variables which
cause spurious correlations between the observable
variables it may be necessary to embed the observ­
ables in a larger dag containing "hidden" variables
in order to build an accurate model. Even when
there exists a simple causal model that fits theory,
it might be desirable to embed the model in a larger
dag to satisfy some higher level constraints. For ex­
ample, suppose that every causal model that fits a
given set of data contains the link a -+ b. Further­
more, suppose that b occurs before a in time and that
causality is assumed to be temporal. Under these cir­
cumstances, the simple causal models are inconsistent
with the higher level constraints on the temporal di­
rection of causality; one way of avoiding this conflict
is to hypothesize the existence of an unknown com­
mon cause, i.e. a +- a -+ b. See Figures 3 and 4 for
examples of the use of hidden variables.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 pro­
vides an efficient criterion for deciding the equiva-

text, including Aab· Since every path activated by
Pab is also activated by Aab, it follows that (3) im­
plies (4). The final implication, that (4) implies (1)
follows from the observation that if a and b are not
d-separated given Pab1 then there must be an active
path between them. If this path contains a node,

of a and b; and for the same reason, the head-to-head
node nearest to a on the path would be a descendant
of a, similarly the one nearest b would be a descen­
dant of b. Both of these head-to-head nodes would
have to be in or be an ancestor of a node in Pab for
the path to be active, but the one nearest a could
not be an ancestor of a, hence both it and a would
be ancestors of b. Similarly, both band the head to
head node nearest it would have to be ancestors of a,
hut this would imply the existence of a directed loop,
hence the path cannot contain any nodes other than
a and b. Therefore the nodes are adjacent. D
The major consequence of this lemma is that adja­
cency is a property determined solely by d-separation,
hence remains invariant among equivalent dags.

Together, these lemmas form a necessary and suf­
ficient condition for equivalence, previously stated in
[Pearl et al 89]:

Since the two invariant properties of a dag identi­
fied in the lemmas are a sufficient condition for equiv­
alence, they lead to a natural canonical representa­
tion of its equivalent class. Simply construct a par­
tially directed graph by removing the arrowheads from
any link of the dag that is not identified by Lemma
2. This partially-directed graph will be called the
rudimentary pattern of the causal model. Since the
rudimentary pattern can be defined solely in terms
of d-separation, it follows that each equivalence class
of causal models has a unique pattern; hence, two
causal models are equivalent if and only if they have
the same pattern. This is a useful view of the prob­
lem since the patterns can be constructed efficiently

A set of equivalent dags possesses another impor­
tant invariant property, namely the directionality of
the uncoupled head-to-head links (i.e. a - b - c
are uncoupled if a and c are not adjacent). There 3
are other links whose directionality remains invariant,

The proof of this lemma relies upon the inherent head. Furthermore, both rudimentary patterns and
differences between a head-to-head junction and the completed patterns offer a compact summary of each
other types of junctions (tail-to-tail and head-to-tail). and every dag in an equivalence class.

The major ramification of Lemma 2 is that the direc­
tionality of a certain class of links can be determined
from d-separation alone. The implications this may
have on the prospects of inferring causal relationships
from independence statements are briefly discussed in
section 4 and in detail in [Verma 90].

The proof of this theorem is based on the lemmas

tive path in one dag has a corresponding active path
in the other. The importance of Theorem 1 is that the
equivalence of two causal models can be determined

Embedded Causal Models

Partially-directed graphs offer an excellent tool for
describing the equivalence classes of causal models;
it would be desirable to find a similar structure for
embedded causal models. Such a structure requires
the ability to represent a direct non-causal correla­
tion between two variables. In a simple dag, when­
ever two variables are unseparable, there must be a
directed link between them, dictating that either the
first causes the second or the second causes the first.
There is no way to represent the existence of an un­
known common cause, as illustrated in the following
embedded causal model (Figure 3 (a)). Assume a, b,
c and d are the observables and a is unobservable.
There is no dag that can represent the dependen­
cies between a, b, c and d using these variables only.
However, the hybrid graph (Figure 3 (b)) which con­
tains a bi-directional link does represent these depen­
dencies. (Under a natural extension of d-separation

Rudimentary embedded patterns can be extended
into completed embedded patterns (or simply, em­
bedded patterns) in much the same way that simple
patterns are completed. The same constraints can be
used for the completion, namely, no arrow head can
be added to the pattern that would (1) create a new
uncoupled head-to-head node or (2) create a strictly
directed cycle. However, note that a strictly directed
cycle contains only singly directed arrows.
While this defines a unique pattern for embedded
every dag, it does so in terms of d-separation con­
ditions over subsets all of Uo, which, in principle,
might require an exponential number of tests. The
next two lemmas show that patterns can be formed
in polynomial time. Lemma 3 delineates the rela­
tionship between adjacency in the pattern and un­
separability in the causal model (parts 1 and 2) and
provides a practical criterion for determining separa­
bility in terms of a simple d-separation test (part 3)
and a graphical test (part 4). The graphical test is
defined in terms of an inducing path:
Definition 2 (Inducing Path) An inducing path be­

tween the variables a and b of an embedded causal
model is any path p satisfying the following two con­
ditions:

hidden common (1} Every observable node on p is head-to-head on p.
{2} Every head-to-head node on p is in Aah•

For hybrid graphs, the notation ab denotes the existence of a link with at least an arrow head pointing
at b, namely either a - b or a +-+ b, while ab de­
notes the existence of a link without any constraints
on its orientation. Thus, for example, when applied
to a dag, ab means a - b or a +- b; while in hybrid
graphs ab denotes the existence of any of the four
possible types of links, (namely, a- b, a- b, a+- b
and a +-+ b). Hybrid graphs can be used to represent

Proof: (Sketch) By definition, (1) is equivalent to
(2) and (2) implies (3). To show that -.J(a, Aab n
Uo, b) implies the existence of an inducing path, con­
sider that this dependency implies the existence of
a path p, between a and b which is active given
Aab n Uo. Since Aab n Uo only contains ancestors
of a and bit follows that every head-to-head node on
p must be in Aab· Thus any observable node on p
that is not head-to-head would be in Aab n Uo and
would serve to deactivate the path, so every observ­
able node on p must be head-to-head. Therefore p is
an inducing path.
To show that the existence of an inducing path im­
plies unseparability relative to Uo hence finish the
proof, consider any two nodes a and b which are con­
nected by an inducing path p. To show a and b are
not d-separated in any context of Uo, consider any
contextS which deactivates p (if p is active for every
context, then the two nodes are unseparable). Since
the only observable nodes of p are head-to-head, only
head-to-head nodes could serve to deactivate p. Each
head-to-head node on p must be in Aab and at least
one must be inactive, given S (otherwise the path
would be active givenS). If all inactive head-to-head
nodes are ancestors of a then consider the one closest
to b, call it y. The portion of p between y and b is ac­
tive, and the ancestry path from y to a can be added
to form an active path between a and b givenS. On
the other hand, if any of the inactive head-to-head
nodes is ancestor of b then pick the head-to-head an­
cestor of b which is closest to a on p and call it z.
Every inactive head-to-head node between a and z
must be an ancestor of a (if any exist), hence there
must be an active path between a and z (either the
portion of p between A and X, or the ancestry path
from the head-to-head node between a and z which is
closest to z concatenated with the portion of p from
that node to z ). Since z is an ancestor of b, the an­
cestry path from z to b can be concatenated to the
path from a to z to form an active path between a
and b givenS. Thus A and Bare unseparable. D

rithm for constructing the characteristic pattern of
any embedded causal model. The final theorem com­
pletes the original task of deciding equivalence.
Theorem 2 Two embedded causal models are equiv­

alent if and only if they have the same pattern.

Thus, Theorem 2 gives validity to the notion of a
pattern as a characteristic representation of an em­
bedded causal model. An interesting consequence of
this theorem is given by the following corollary:
Corollary 1 There are fewer than siUol� distinct
embedded causal models containing IUol variables,·
moreover, every embedded causal model is equivalent
to a simple dag with fewer than 1Uol2 variables.
Part 1 follows from the fact that every embedded
causal model is equivalent to its pattern, and every
pattern contains fewer than I Uo I edges (there are four
types of edges). The second part stems from the fact
that a bi-directional link a +-+ b in a pattern can be
represented by a single hidden common cause ex of
the observable variables, namely, a - ex -+ b.

Applications to the Synthe­
sis of Causal Models

The problem of deciding the equivalence of (embed­
ded) causal models is fundamental to causal reason­
ing and theory building, as it allows us to determine
which structural properties of the model (e.g. con­
nectivity or directionality) can be substantiated by
data and which serve merely for representational con­
venience. The canonical representations presented
in this paper offer an efficient solution to this prob­
lem since they can be constructed (from the causal
models) in polynomial time. They can also be used
to solve the broader problem of model subsumption
[Verma 90).
The construction of these canonical representations
is based on (conditional) independence relationships,
thus suggesting the possibility of extracting causal
models directly from statistical information. Such
application meets with the difficulty that, in general,
probability distributions do not define unique graph­
ical models. In other words, given that the data is
generated by some causal theory T =< D, e >, it
is always possible to contrive the parameters e to
yield spurious independencies, not shown in D, that
fit another theory T' =< D', e' >, with D' not equiv­
alent to D. [Spirtes et al 90) show that, under some
reasonable assumptions, the occurrence of such spu­
rious independencies is a rare event of measure zero,
and therefore argue that it is natural in causal mod­
eling to assume that the underlying distribution is
dag-isomorphic 4, albeit allowing for the inclusion of
unobserved variables.

covery algorithm is proposed in [Spirtes et al 90] and
several alternatives are discussed in the sequel.
The basic algorithm has three parts; the first part
is an application of Lemma 1 that identifies the links
of the pattern. The second part of the algorithm is
an application of Lemma 2 which adds directionality
to some of the links, thus forming the rudimentary
pattern. The final part of the algorithm consists of
completing the rudimentary pattern into a full pat­
tern (if desired).

The complexity of this algorithm is bounded by

greatly reduced by the generation of a Markov net­
work. A Markov network is the undirected graph
formed by linking every pair of variables a and b
that are dependent given the rest of the variables
(i.e. -.I(a, U- ab, b)). The Markov network of a
dag-isomorphic distribution has the property that the
parents of any variable in the dag form a clique in the
network. Since Lemma 1 states that any two vari­
ables a and b are separable if and only if they are
separated by their parent set Pab, the search for a
separating set can be confined to the cliques that con­
tain either a or b. Thus, the complexity is bounded,
exponentially, by the size of the largest clique in the
Markov network, and this coincides with the theoret­
ical lower bound for recovery of a dag from indepen­
dence information [Verma 90].

model as well. The only difference is in the output;
when the algorithm is applied to a dag isomorphic
distribution, every link is guaranteed to be assigned
at most one arrowhead (a particular arrowhead may
actually be assigned multiple times, but no link will
receive an arrowhead on both ends). However, when
the distribution is isomorphic to an embedded dag it
is possible for a link to be assigned an arrowhead on
both ends, hence the recovery of a bi-directional link.

[Spirtes et al 90] have proposed an algorithm for
identifying causal relationships which accepts many,
but not all, of the genuine and potential causes in
distributions that are isomorphic to embedded dags.
The relationships identified by [Spirtes et al 90] cor­
respond to the singly directed arrows of the rudimen­
tary pattern.
In practice, every recovery algorithm must face
the problem of inferring independence relations from
sampled data. The number of samples required to
reliably test the assertion I(a, Sab• b) grows exponen­
tia11y with the size of Sah· A reasonable approximat­
ing algorithm for recovering a dag (or embedded dag)
could be devised based upon the following redefinition
of the independence relation:

The invariant nature of the arrows in a pattern
can form the basis for a general non-temporal defini­
tion of causation; one that determines the direction of
causal influences from statistical data without resort­
ing to chronological information, and one that applies
to general distributions, including those that are not
isomorphic to embedded dags. The essence of this
definition can be articulated by taking as models of
