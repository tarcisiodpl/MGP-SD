Questions concerning mediated causal effects are of great interest in psychology, cognitive
science, medicine, social science, public health, and many other disciplines. For instance,
about 60% of recent papers published in leading journals in social psychology contain at
least one mediation test (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011). Standard parametric
approaches to mediation analysis employ regression models, and either the “difference
method” (Judd & Kenny, 1981), more common in epidemiology, or the “product method”
(Baron & Kenny, 1986), more common in the social sciences. In this paper we first discuss
a known, but perhaps often unappreciated fact: that these parametric approaches are a
special case of a general counterfactual framework for reasoning about causality first
described by Neyman (1923), and Rubin (1974), and linked to causal graphical models by
J. Robins (1986), and Pearl (2000). We then show a number of advantages of this
framework. First, it makes the strong assumptions underlying mediation analysis explicit.
Second, it avoids a number of problems present in the product and difference methods,
such as biased estimates of effects in certain cases. Finally, we show the generality of this
framework by proving a novel result which allows mediation analysis to be applied to
longitudinal settings with unobserved confounders.

Counterfactual Graphical Models for Longitudinal Mediation Analysis with Unobserved
Confounding
The aim of empirical research in many disciplines is establishing the presence of
effects by means of either randomized trials, or observational studies if randomization is
not possible. For example, a celebrated success of empirical research in epidemiology is the
discovery of a causal connection between smoking and lung cancer (Doll & Hill, 1950).
Once the presence of an effect is established, the precise mechanism of the effect
becomes a topic of interest as well. A particularly popular type of mechanism analysis
concerns questions of mediation, that is to what extent a given effect of one variable on
another is direct, and to what extent is it mediated by a third variable. For example, it is
known that genetic variants on chromosome 15q25.1 increase both smoking behavior, and
the risk of lung cancer (VanderWeele et al., 2012). A public health mediation question of
interest here is whether these variants increase lung cancer risk by directly making the
patients susceptible in some way, or whether the risk increase is driven by the increase in
smoking.
In psychology, interest in mediation analysis began partly due to the influential
S-O-R model (Woodworth, 1928), where causal relationships between stimulus and
response are mediated by mechanisms internal to an organism, and partly due to the
multi-stage causality present in many theories in psychology (such as attitude causing
intentions, which in turn cause behavior in social psychology). Today, mediation questions
are ubiquitous in psychology. Mediation analysis is used to explicate theories of persuasion
(Tormala, Briñol, & Petty, 2007), ease of retrieval (Schwarz et al., 1991), (Tormala, Falces,
Briñol, & Petty, 2007), cognitive priming (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993), developmental
psychology (Conger et al., 1990), and explore many other areas. In fact, about 60% of
recent papers published in leading journals in social psychology contain at least one
mediation test (Rucker et al., 2011).
A standard approach for mediation analysis involves the use of (linear) structural

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

equation models, and the so called “difference method” (Judd & Kenny, 1981), and
“product method” (Baron & Kenny, 1986). The first method, more common in
epidemiology, considers an outcome model both with and without the mediator and takes
the difference in the coefficients for the exposure as the measure of the indirect effect. The
second method, more common in the social sciences, takes as a measure of the indirect
effect the product of (i) the coefficient for the exposure in the model for the mediator and
(ii) the coefficient for the mediator in the model for the outcome. These methods suffer
from a number of problems. First, interpreting linear regression parameters as causal
parameters is not appropriate when non-linearities or interactions are present in the
underlying causal mechanism, and can lead to bias (D. MacKinnon & Dwyer, 1993),
(Kaufman, MacLehose, & Kaufman, 2004). Second, it is not always the case that a
regression parameter is interpretable as a causal parameter, even if the parametric
structural assumptions of linearity and no interaction hold (J. Robins, 1986). Finally, these
methods are not directly applicable to longitudinal settings (where multiple treatments
happen over time) and assume no unmeasured confounding.
The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we describe recent developments in the causal
inference literature which address the limitations of the approaches based on linear
structural equations (Judd & Kenny, 1981), (Baron & Kenny, 1986). In particular, we
show that the linear structural equation approach to mediation analysis is a special case of
a more general framework based on potential outcome counterfactuals, developed by
Neyman (1923) and Rubin (1974), and extended and linked to non-parametric structural
equations and graphical models by J. Robins (1986), and Pearl (2000). We show how this
more general framework avoids the difficulties of the linear structural equations approach,
and has additional advantages in making strong causal assumptions necessary for
mediation analysis explicit. Second, we use the counterfactual framework to develop novel
results which extend existing mediation analysis techniques to longitudinal settings with
some degree of unmeasured confounding.

Our argument is that to handle increasingly complex mediation questions in
psychology and cognitive science, scientists must necessarily move beyond the linear
structural equation approach, and embrace more general frameworks for mediation analysis.
The linear structural equation approach is simply not applicable in complex data analysis
settings, and careless generalizations of this approach will lead to biased conclusions.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe mediation analysis based
on linear structural equations in more detail, and describe situations where the use of this
method leads to problems. In section 3, we introduce a causal inference framework based
on potential outcome counterfactuals and graphical models, and show how this framework
generalizes the linear structural equation framework, and correctly handles the problems
described in section 2. In section 4, we describe two motivating examples involving three
complications: unobserved confounding, longitudinal treatments, and path-specific effects,
and show how the counterfactual framework is able to handle these complications with ease.
Section 5 contains the discussion and our conclusions. The general theory necessary to
solve examples of the type shown in section 4 is contained in the supplementary materials.

Mediation Analysis Using Linear Structural Equations Models
The standard mediation setting contains three variables, the cause or treatment
variable, which we will denote by A, the effect or outcome variable, which we will denote by
Y , and the mediator variable, which we will denote by M. The treatment A is assumed to
have an effect on both mediator M and outcome Y , while the mediator M has an effect on
the outcome Y . A typical goal of causal inference is establishing the presence of the total
effect, or just the causal effect, of A on Y . The goal of mediation analysis is to decompose
the total effect into the direct effect of the treatment A on the outcome Y , with the indirect
or mediated effect of the treatment A on the outcome Y through the mediator M.
Causal relationships in mediation analysis are often displayed by means of causal
diagrams. A causal diagram is a directed graph where nodes represent variables of interest,

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

6

in our case the treatment A, the mediator M, and the outcome Y , and directed arrows
represent, loosely, “direct causation.” The mediation setting is typically represented by
means of a causal diagram shown in Fig. 1 (a).
The situation represented by this picture contains a treatment that is either
randomly assigned by the experimenter, or randomized naturally. For example, genetic
variants on chromosome 15q25.1 which are linked with smoking behavior and lung cancer
(VanderWeele et al., 2012) can generally (modulo possibly some confounding due to
population genetics) be assumed to be naturally randomized. In psychology, a randomized
treatment is often a treatment or prevention program, such as drug prevention.
Another common situation assumes that the treatment is not randomized, but all
causes of the treatment are observed. One example of this situation is shown in Fig. 1 (b),
which contains a single observed confounder C. Extending methods described in this
section to this case is straightforward.
Given the causal structure shown in Fig. 1, the statistical analysis proceeds as
follows. First, the causal relationships between treatment, mediator and outcome are
assumed to take the form of a causal regression model, or linear structural equation:

Y = α0 + α1 · A + α2 · M + ǫy

(1)

M = β0 + β1 · A + ǫm

(2)

where α0 , β0 are intercepts, α1 , α2 , β1 are regression coefficients, ǫy , ǫm are mean zero noise
terms, and the covariance of the noise terms for Y and M is assumed to equal 0:
Cov(ǫy , ǫm ) = 0.
For the “difference method”, a regression model for the outcome where the mediator
is omitted is also included in the analysis:

Y = γ0 + γ1 · A + ǫ′y

(3)

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

7

For binary outcomes, it is straightforward to specify alternative regression models,
such as logistic regression models. However, as we shall soon see, even this simple modeling
change requires care.
The total effect under these models is taken to equal to (α1 + α2 · β1 ), and can be
derived using Sewall Wright’s rules of path analysis (Wright, 1921). The direct effect under
these models is taken to equal to the regression coefficient α1 of the treatment in the
outcome model (equation 1). The “product method” (Baron & Kenny, 1986), and the
“difference method” (Judd & Kenny, 1981) both aim to express the indirect effect of A on
Y in terms of statistical parameters of these regression models. The product method takes
as a measure of the indirect effect the product of (i) the coefficient for the treatment in the
model for the mediator (β1 in equation 2), and (ii) the coefficient for the mediator in the
model for the outcome (α2 in equation 1). The difference method considers the outcome
model with (equation 1) and without the mediator (equation 3), and takes the difference in
the coefficients for the treatment in these two models (α1 and γ1 ) as the measure of the
indirect effect. If the outcome and mediator are continuous and there are no interaction
terms in the regression model for the outcome, the two methods produce identical answers
for the indirect effect (D. P. MacKinnon, Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995).
An important property in mediation analysis is the decomposition property:

Total effect = Direct Effect + Indirect Effect

(4)

This property allows the investigator to quantify how much of an existing total effect of
treatment on outcome is due to the direct influence on the outcome, and how much is due
to the influenced mediated by a third variable. Note that it is possible for the total effect
to be weak or non-existent, and direct and indirect effects to both be strong. This situation
can occur due to cancellation of effects. For instance, there may be a strong positive direct
effect, but an equally strong negative mediated effect, resulting in a weak total effect. The

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

8

decomposition property holds for linear structural equation models with continuous
outcomes, for indirect effects defined by both the product and difference methods.
The advantage of the product and difference methods is their simplicity – they rely
on standard software for fitting regression models. The disadvantage is their lack of
flexibility. In order to work, these methods require assumptions of linearity, no unmeasured
confounding between mediator and outcome, and continuous outcomes. As we will see in
the next section, careless application of these methods in settings where one or more of
these assumptions are violated will result in bias, and counterintuitive conclusions.

Problems with the Product and Difference Methods
With binary outcomes (D. MacKinnon & Dwyer, 1993), or interaction terms in the
outcome (VanderWeele & Vansteelandt, 2009), the two methods above no longer agree on
the estimate of the indirect effect. In addition, there is evidence that in the case of
non-linearities or interactions in the outcome model, neither method gives a satisfactory
measure of the indirect effect (VanderWeele & Vansteelandt, 2009).
Furthermore, even for the case of continuous outcome models with no interaction
terms, certain underlying causal structures can make it impossible to associate any
standard regression parameter with direct and indirect effects. Consider the causal diagram
shown in Fig. 2. This diagram represents a situation where we have a randomized
treatment A and the outcome Y , but instead of a single mediator, we have two mediating
variables L and M. Furthermore, we have reasons to believe there is a strong source of
unobserved confounding (which we call U) between one of the mediators L and the
outcome Y . For instance, if A represents a primary prevention program (say drug
prevention), and M represents a secondary prevention program (say a program designed to
increase screening rates for serious illness), then L might represent some observable
intermediate outcome of people enrolled in the primary program, perhaps linked to
eventual outcome Y via some unobserved measure of conscientiousness or health

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

consciousness. Assume for the moment that all variables are continuous, and we can model
their relationships using linear regression models:

Y = α0 + α1 · A + α2 · M + α3 · L + ǫy

(5)

M = β0 + β1 · A + β2 · L + ǫm

(6)

L = δ0 + δ1 · A + ǫl

(7)

We model the presence of the U confounder by allowing that Cov(ǫy , ǫl ) 6= 0, while
assuming Cov(ǫy , ǫm ) = 0, Cov(ǫm , ǫl ) = 0. We still assume mean zero error terms. Note
that though the directed arrows in the graph in Fig. 2 are causal, not all of the regression
coefficients in above equations have causal interpretations. In particular, α1 , and α3 do not
have causal interpretations, while α2 does (as the direct effect of M on Y ).
We are interested in quantifying the direct effect of A on Y , and the effect of A on Y
mediated by M. The question is, what (combination of) parameters of the regression
models we specified correspond to these effects. A naive approach would be to consider a
regression model in equation (5), and take the regression parameter α1 associated with A
as the measure of the direct effect. This approach is wrong, and will lead to bias. The
difficulty with this example is that a regression coefficient of a particular independent
variable X represents the extent to which the dependent variable Y depends on X given
that we condition on all other independent variables. In our example, the regression
coefficient for A represents dependence of Y on A given that we conditioned on L and M
(we do not condition on U since U is not observed). Unfortunately, conditioning on L
makes U and A dependent due to the phenomenon known as “explaining away.”
Consider a toy causal system: a light in a hallway is wired to two toggle light
switches on the opposite ends of the hallway. If either of the light switches is flipped, the

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

10

light turns on. Two people, Alice and Uma, stand at opposite ends of the hallway, each
near a switch. Alice sees the light turn on, and knows she did not toggle the switch. She
can then conclude (“explain away” the light turning on) that Uma toggled the switch. In
our graph, Alice’s switch is A, Uma’s switch is U, and the light itself is L. Conditional on
L, we can learn information about U if we know something about A. In other words,
conditional on L, A and U become dependent. Of course, U is a direct cause of Y . This
means that some of the variation of Y due to A, represented by the regression coefficient of
A in equation (5) is actually due to the “explaining away” effect correlating A and U,
which in turn correlates A and Y in a non-causal way. In particular, even if there is no
direct effect of A on Y , the regression coefficient of A will not vanish in most models.
In fact, it can be shown that in examples of this sort, the presence of unobserved
confounders, coupled with the “explaining away” effect will preventing us from associating
any standard function of regression coefficients with causal parameters in a way that avoids
bias. Furthermore, even if the correct expression for the direct effect is used (as derived in
a subsequent section, and shown in equation 17), using standard statistical models in that
expression can result in cases where the absence of direct effect is not possible given the
model. In particular, if we use a linear regression model with no interaction terms for a
continuous outcome Y , and a logistic regression model with no interaction terms for a
binary mediator L, then the absence of direct effect is impossible given those models in the
sense that the expression in (17) will never equal 0. This difficulty, which applies not only
to regression models but to almost any standard parametric statistical model associated
with causal diagrams such as Fig. 2, is known as the “null paradox” (J. M. Robins &
Wasserman, 1997).
Finally, even if assumptions of linearity, no interaction, and no unobserved
confounding hold, no function of the observed data will equal to either direct or indirect
effect in general. In order for this equality to hold, it must be the case that error terms of
the outcome and mediator model remain uncorrelated for any possible set of assignments of

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

11

independent variables to the model. This assumption is also necessary in order to derive
mediation effects from double randomization studies (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1974)
(Imai, Tingley, & Yamamoto, 2013). The assumption cannot easily be tested, and can be
viewed as ruling out unobserved confounding between variables in different counterfactual
situations. It will be described in more detail later. Deriving analogues of this crucial
assumption in more complex settings, for the purposes of sensitivity analysis, can be
challenging.
A way out of many of these difficulties involves generalizing from linear regression
models to a general non-parametric framework based on potential outcome counterfactuals.
This framework will be described in great detail in the next section. We will show how this
framework gives a more general representation of direct and indirect effects that will
happen to coincide with the results of the product and difference methods in the special
case of linear regression models. We will also show how assumptions underlying mediation
analysis can be clearly explained as independence statements among random
counterfactual variables, displayed graphically by a causal diagram. We will discuss
possible solutions to the null paradox that can be derived in this framework. Finally, the
flexibility of the framework will allow us to pose more complex questions of mediation, such
as “what is the effect of A on Y along the path A → M → Y in the graph in Fig. 2?” and
answer these questions in complex settings involving multiple time-dependent treatments,
and unobserved confounding.

Potential Outcomes and Mediation
Typically, the notion of causal effect of treatment A on outcome Y refers to change in
the outcome between the control group and the test group in a randomized control trial. A
general representation of causality, divorced from a particular statistical model such as a
regression model must capture this notion in some way. An idealized, mathematical
representation of a randomized control trial captures the notion of controlling a variable by

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

12

means of an intervention. An intervention on A, denoted by do(a) by Pearl (2000), refers
to an operation that fixes the value of A to a regardless of the natural variability of A. An
intervention represents an assignment of treatment to the test group, or a decision to set A
to a. The variation in the outcome after an intervention is captured by means of an
interventional distribution, sometimes denoted by p(y|do(a)).
Crucially, intervening to force A to value a is not the same as observing that A
attains the value a, that is: p(y|a) 6= p(y|do(a)). As an example: “only Olympic sprinters
that can run quickly win gold medals (observation), therefore I should wear a gold medal
to run faster (intervention)” 1 . This is the essence of the common refrain that correlation
(statistical dependence) does not imply causation.
A potential outcome counterfactual refers to the value of a random variable under a
particular intervention do(a) for a particular unit (individual) u, and is denoted by Y (a, u).
If we wish to average over units in a particular study, we would obtain a random variable
Y (a), representing variation in the outcome after the intervention do(a) was performed. In
other words, Y (a) is a random variable with a distribution p(y|do(a)).
Assume for the moment the simplest mediation setting with variables A, M, Y ,
shown in Fig. 1, and assume the causal relationships between A, M, and Y can be
captured by structural equations shown in equations (1), and (2). The intervention do(a)
in these systems of equations is represented by replacing the random variable A in each
equation with the intervened value a. Alternatively, if we augment equations (1) and (2)
with another equation for A itself, such as:

A = ǫa

(8)

then the intervention on A can be represented by replacing equation (8) by another
equation that sets A to a constant a. If interventions are represented in this way, then the
1

We want to thank the lesswrong.com community for this example.

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

13

total effect of A on Y , equal to (α1 + α2 · β1 ), can be viewed as

Total Effect = E[Y (a = 1) − Y (a = 0)] = E[Y (1)] − E[Y (0)]

(9)

In other words, the total effect is the expected difference of outcomes under two
hypothetical interventions. In one intervention, A is set to 1, and in another A is set to 0.
Note that this definition is non-parametric in that it does not rely on the model for Y
being a linear regression model. In fact, the definition remains sensible even if we replace
the models for Y and M by arbitrary functions:

Y = fy (M, A, ǫy )

(10)

M = fm (A, ǫm )

(11)

A = fa (ǫa )

(12)

These models can be viewed as (non-parametric) structural equations, and are discussed in
great detail by Pearl (2000). The key idea is that we assume the causal relationship
between a variable, say Y , and its direct causes is by means of some unrestricted causal
mechanism function fy . These structural models can still be modeled by means of causal
diagrams, but are no longer bound by linearity, lack of interactions, or other parametric
assumptions.

Direct and Indirect Effects As Potential Outcomes
Representing direct and indirect effects using potential outcomes is slightly more
involved. In the case of total effects, the intuition was that A being set to 0 represents “no
treatment,” while A being set to 1 represents “treatment,” and we want to subtract off the
expected outcome under no treatment (the baseline effect) from the expected outcome
under treatment. In the case of direct effects we still would like to subtract off the baseline,

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

14

but from the effect that considers only the direct influence of A on Y in some way.
One approach that preserves the attractive property of decomposition of total effects
into direct and indirect effects proceeds as follows. We consider a two stage potential
outcome. In the first stage, we consider for a particular unit u, the value the mediator
would take under baseline treatment a = 0: M(0, u). We then consider the outcome value
of that same unit if the treatment was set to 1, and mediator was set to M(0, u):
Y (1, M(0, u), u). In other words, the direct influence of A on Y for this unit is quantified
by the value of the outcome in a hypothetical situation where we give the individual the
treatment, but also force the mediator variable to behave as if we did not give the
individual treatment. In graphical terms, this is the outcome value if active treatment
a = 1 is only active along the direct path A → Y , but not active along the path
A → M → Y , since we force M to behave as if treatment was set to 0 for the purposes of
that path. If we average over units, we get a nested potential outcome random variable:
Y (1, M(0)). We define the direct effect as the difference in expectation between this
random variable, and the baseline outcome:

Direct Effect = E[Y (1, M(0))] − E[Y (0)]

(13)

Note that E[Y (0)] = E[Y (0, M(0))]. The indirect effect is defined similarly, expect
we now subtract off the direct influence of A on Y from the total effect of setting A to 1:

Indirect Effect = E[Y (1)] − E[Y (1, M(0))]

(14)

It is not difficult to show that these definition reduce to definitions in terms of regression
coefficients given in the previous sections in the special case where Y is continuous, fy , and
fm are linear functions with no interactions, and all ǫ noise terms are Gaussian. However,
these effect definitions, known as natural (Pearl, 2001) or pure (J. M. Robins & Greenland,
1992) are the only sensible definitions of direct and indirect effects currently known that

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

15

simultaneously maintain the decomposition property (4), and apply to arbitrary functions
in structural equations (10), (11), and (12).

Assumptions Underlying Mediation Analysis

Defining the influence of A on Y for a particular unit u as Y (1, M(0, u), u) involved a
seemingly impossible hypothetical situation, where the treatment given to u was 0 for the
purposes of the mediator M, and 1 for the purposes of the outcome Y . In other words, this
situation is a function of multiple, conflicting hypothetical worlds. In general, no
experimental design is capable of representing this situation unless it is possible to bring
the unit by some means to the pre-intervention state (perhaps by means of a “washout
period,” or some other method). In order to express direct and indirect effects defined in
the previous section as functions of the observed data, such as regression coefficients, we
must be willing to make certain assumptions that make our impossible hypothetical
situation amenable to statistical analysis.
A typical assumption that makes our situation tractable is expressed in terms of
conditional independence statements on potential outcome counterfactuals:

Y (1, m) ⊥
⊥ M(0)

(15)

where (X ⊥
⊥ Y ) stands for “X is marginally independent of Y”, and (X ⊥
⊥ Y |Z) stands for
“X is conditionally independent of Y given Z.”
This assumption states that if we happen to have some information on how the
mediator varies after treatment is set to 0, this does not give us any information about how
the outcome varies if we set the treatment to 1 and the mediator to (arbitrary) m. Note
that this assumption immediately follows if we assume independent error terms in a
non-parametric structural equation model defined by (10), (11), (12). This assumption

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

16

allows us to perform the following derivation:

p(Y (1, M(0))) =

X

p(Y (1, m), M(0) = m) =

m

X

p(Y (1, m)) · p(M(0) = m)

(16)

m

This derivation expressed our potential outcome as a product of two terms, with each of
these terms representing variation in a random variable after a well defined intervention.
This represents progress, since we were able to express a random variable not typically
representable by any experimental design in terms of results of two well defined randomized
trials, one involving Y as the outcome and A, M as treatments, and one involving M as the
outcome, and A as treatment.
Unfortunately, even a single randomized study can be expensive or possibly illegal to
perform on people (if the treatment is harmful), let alone two. For this reason a common
goal in causal inference is to find ways of expressing interventional distributions as
functions of observed data. In the causal inference literature this problem is known as the
identification problem of causal effects.
As mentioned earlier, the interventional distribution, such as that corresponding to
Y (a), namely p(y|do(a)), is not necessarily equal to a conditional distribution p(y|a).
Nevertheless, such an equality holds if there is no unobserved confounders, or common
causes between A and Y . This happens to be the case in our example. In terms of
potential outcomes, the lack of unobserved confounding is expressed in terms of the
ignorability assumption
Y (a) ⊥
⊥A
In words, this assumption states that if we happen to have information on the treatment
variable, it does not give us any information about the outcome Y after the intervention
do(a) was performed. A graphical way of describing ignorability is to say that there does
not exist certain kinds of paths between A and Y , called back-door paths (Pearl, 2000), in
the causal diagram. Such paths are called “back-door” because they start with an arrow

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

17

pointing into A. It can be shown that if ignorability holds for Y (a) and A (alternatively if
there are no back-door paths from A to Y in the corresponding causal diagram), then
p(y|do(a)) = p(y|a).
If there exist common causes of A and Y but they are observed, as is the case of node
C in Fig. 1 (b), it is possible to express a more general assumption known as the
conditional ignorability assumption

Y (a) ⊥
⊥ A|C

In words, this assumption states that if we happen to have information on the treatment
variable, then conditional on the observed confounder C, this information gives us no
information about the outcome Y after the intervention do(a) was performed. In graphical
terms, this assumption is equivalent to stating that C “blocks” all back-door paths from A
to Y 2 . It can be shown that if conditional ignorability (Y (a) ⊥
⊥ A|C) holds, then
p(y|do(a)) =

P

c

p(y|a, c)p(c). This formula is known as the back-door formula, or the

adjustment formula.
Sometimes, identification of causal effects is possible even in the presence of
unobserved confounding. See the work of Tian and Pearl (2002a), Huang and Valtorta
(2006), and Shpitser and Pearl (2006b, 2006a, 2008) for a general treatment of the causal
effect identification problem.
In our case, the ignorability assumption for M(a) and A, as well as for Y (1, m) and
A, M allows us to further express each of the terms in the product in (16) in terms of
observed data as follows:

X
m

2

p(Y (1, m)) · p(M(0) = m) =

X

p(Y |A = 1, m) · p(m|A = 0)

m

Pearl (1988, 2000) gives a more detailed discussion of the notion of “blocking” that has to be employed
here.

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

18

Plugging this last expression into the formula (13) for direct effects gives us

X

{E[Y |A = 1, m] − E[Y |A = 0, m]} p(m|A = 0)

m

This expression is known as the mediation formula (Pearl, 2011). Note that the mediation
formula does not require a particular functional form for causal mechanisms relating Y , M
and A.
Note also that assumption (15) is untestable, since it is positing a marginal
independence between two potential outcomes, one of which involves the treatment being
set to 1, and another involves the treatment being set to 0. A form of this assumption is
still necessary in order to equate direct and indirect effects with functions of regression
coefficients in the simple linear regression setting described in previous sections, in the
sense that violations of the assumption will generally prevent us from uniquely expressing a
given direct or indirect effect as a function of observed data (e.g. the effect becomes
non-identifiable.) For this reason, even in the simplest mediation problems, care must be
taken to either justify assumption (15) on strong substantive grounds, perform a
reasonable sensitivity analysis (Tchetgen & Shpitser, 2012a), or reduce the mediation
problem to a testable problem involving interventions without conflicts (J. M. Robins &
Richardson, 2010).
Mediation with Unobserved Confounding
One of the advantages of the potential outcome framework is its flexibility. Since it
does not rely on parametric assumptions, it can be readily extended to handle modeling
complications. Consider again our two mediator example in Fig. 2. We mentioned in the
previous section that product and difference methods will result in biased estimates of
direct effects of A on Y not through M, due to a combination of unobserved confounding
and the “explaining away” effect in that example. A non-parametric definition of direct
effect based on potential outcomes avoids these difficulties. Our expression for direct effect

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

19

is E[Y (1, M(0))] − E[Y (0)]. Since A is randomized (there is no unobserved confounding
between A and the outcome Y ), the second term can be shown to equal E[Y |A = 0]. The
first term can be shown, given assumption (15), and a general theory of identification of
causal effects (Tian & Pearl, 2002a),(Shpitser & Pearl, 2006b, 2008) to equal

E[Y (1, M(0))] =

X X
m

!

E[Y |m, l, A = 1]p(l|A = 1) p(m|A = 0)

l

The direct effect is then equal to

Direct Effect =

X X
m

!

E[Y |m, l, A = 1]p(l|A = 1) p(m|A = 0) − E[Y |A = 0]

l

(17)

while the indirect effect is equal to

Indirect Effect = E[Y |A = 1] −

X X
m

l

!

E[Y |m, l, A = 1]p(l|A = 1) p(m|A = 0)

It can be shown that not only do the direct and indirect effects add up to the total effect in
this case, but the quantity (17) equals 0 precisely when the effect of A on Y along the arrow
A → Y is in some sense absent.3 However, even though we used simple linear regression
models in this example, neither of these effects reduces to any straightforward function of
the regression coefficients. It is possible to express these kinds of functional as functions of
regression coefficients in an appropriately adjusted model (such as the marginal structural
model, which is estimated by fitting weighted regression models (J. M. Robins, Hernan, &
Brumback, 2000)), or as functions of parameters in a non-standard parameterization of
causal models, where statistical parameters correspond to causal parameters directly
(Shpitser, Richardson, & Robins, 2011),(Richardson, Robins, & Shpitser, 2012).
3

As long as the parametric models for the functionals in the formula are general enough to avoid the “null
paradox” issue. Linear regressions for all terms suffice, but a no-interaction linear regression for a continuous
outcome Y , and a no-interaction logistic regression for a binary mediator L does not suffice. The general
rule of thumb is the models must be general enough to permit the above mean differences to equal zero for
some parameter settings.

Path-specific Longitudinal Mediation with Unobserved Confounding
In the previous section we saw how the presence of unobserved confounders and
multiple mediators can easily result in situations where regression coefficients cannot be
meaningfully associated with direct and indirect causal effects. In this section, we consider
even more complex mediation settings, which can nevertheless be handled appropriately
using the potential outcome counterfactual framework representing (possibly non-linear)
structural equations. We motivate the discussion with two examples, one from HIV
research, and one from psychology.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS by attacking and destroying
helper T cells. If the concentration of these cells falls below a critical threshold,
cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the patient eventually dies to an opportunistic
infection. Patients infected with HIV with reduced T cell counts are typically put on
courses of anti retroviral therapy (ART), as a first line therapy. Unfortunately, side effects
of many types of ART medication may cause poor adherence to the therapy (that is,
patients do not always take the medication on time, or stop taking it altogether). Side
effects are often caused by toxicity of the medication, or patient’s adverse reaction to the
medication. Severity of the side effects is often linked to the patient’s “overall health level”
(ill defined, and thus not measured), which also affects the eventual outcome of the therapy
(survival or death). If the ART happens to not be very effective at viral suppression, and
results in patient deaths, this could be because the ART itself is not very good, or it could
be due to poor patient adherence. In other words, poor outcomes of ART results in a
natural mediation question in HIV research – is the poor total effect possibly due to
cancellation of a strong direct effect of the medication on survival by an equally strong
indirect effect of poor adherence?
The situation is shown graphically in Fig. 3. Here, we show ART taken over the
course of two months, represented by two time slices. In practical studies, ART is taken
over a period of years, and the number of time slices is quite large. In this graph, the ART

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

21

is represented by nodes A0 and A1 , the patient outcome by Y , patient adherence at each
time slice by M1 and M2 , toxicity of the medication by L1 , L2 , and finally the unobserved
state of patient’s health affecting reaction to the medication and the outcome by U. Since
we are interested in the indirect effect of ART on survival mediated by adherence, we are
only interested in the effect along the paths from A0 , A1 on Y which pass through M1 , M2 .
These paths are shown in green in the graph.
Our second example, which is isomorphic to the HIV example above, concerns the use
of prevention programs, to promote positive outcomes in vulnerable populations. Assume
the primary interventions A0 , A1 involve attending a drug prevention program. Like ART
in the previous example, the program is an ongoing intervention (say a monthly meeting).
However, there is also a secondary intervention M1 , M2 which is meant to increase the rates
of screening for serious illness such as cancer. Although the secondary intervention is not
directly related to drug prevention, it is conceivable that there is a synergistic effect
between the primary and secondary intervention to promote positive outcomes (say staying
drug free), perhaps due to the fact that both interventions promote good habits and health
consciousness. In this example, L1 , L2 are, loosely speaking, “the participant’s
responsiveness” which may be affected by unobserved factors involving family, friends,
socioeconomic background (U), and so on. These unobserved factors also influence the
outcome. The mediation question here is quantifying the extent to which the outcome is
influenced by the primary intervention itself, versus an indirect effect via the secondary
intervention. The indirect effect mediated by the secondary intervention is, again, shown in
green in Fig. 3.
Aside from unobserved confounding represented by U, a complication also present in
the example in Fig. 2 in the previous section, what makes these examples difficult is first
the longitudinal setting where treatments recur over multiple time slices, and second that
we are interested in effects along a particular bundle of causal paths. In previous sections
we were interested in effects either only along the direct path A → Y , or only along all

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

22

paths other than the direct one. In these cases we are interested in some indirect paths
(through M1 , M2 ), but not others (through L1 , L2 ).
In the case of multiple treatments, causal effect from these treatments to the outcome
Y is transmitted along special paths called proper causal paths of the form Ak → . . . → Y ,
where Ak is one of the treatments, and where this path cannot intersect any other
treatment other than Ak (otherwise it is really a causal path from that second treatment to
the outcome). We are interested in quantifying the effect along a subset of such paths,
displayed graphically as those paths consisting entirely of green arrows. Algebraically, we
will denote this set of paths of interest as π. The proper causal paths along which the
causal effect is transmitted but which do not lie in π is displayed graphically as those paths
which contain at least one blue arrow.

Formalization of Path-Specific Effects
Naturally, even if the statistical model associated with the causal diagram shown in
Fig. 3 is given in terms of linear regressions, it is not possible to express effects of interest
as simple functions of regression coefficients. However, it is possible to express these
path-specific effects (Pearl, 2001),(Avin, Shpitser, & Pearl, 2005) in terms of potential
outcome counterfactuals.
We will use an inductive rule to construct a potential outcome representing the effect
of A0 , A1 on Y only along green paths. For the purposes of this rule, we will represent
values a′0 , a′1 of A0 , A1 to represent “baseline treatment” or ”no treatment” (in the previous
section we used 0), and values a0 , a1 to represent “active treatment” (in the previous
section we used 1). This potential outcome will involve Y , and interventions on all direct
causes of Y (that is all nodes X such that X → Y exists in the graph). These interventions
are defined as follows.
If the arrow X → Y is blue, this means we are not interested in the effect transmitted
along this arrow. In previous sections we represented this by considering the value of X “as

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

23

if treatment was baseline,” or X(0). In our case we will do the same, except since we have
two treatments we set them both to the baseline values a′0 , a′1 . For example, L1 and L2 are
both direct causes of Y along blue arrows. This means we intervene on whatever values
they would have had if A0 , A1 were set to baseline, or L1 (a′0 , a′1 ), L2 (a′0 , a′1 ). If the direct
cause of Y is one of the treatments A0 or A1 then we intervene to set their value to
“active” if the arrow from treatment to outcome is green (e.g. we are interested in the
effect), or “baseline” if the arrow is blue (e.g. we are not interested in the effect). Finally, if
the direct cause of Y is not a treatment, but is a direct cause along a green arrow, we
inductively set the value of that cause to whatever value it would have had under a
path-specific effect of A0 , A1 on that cause. For instance, M1 is a direct cause of Y along a
green arrow, which means we set the value of M1 to whatever value is dictated by the
path-specific effect of A0 , A1 on M1 . To figure out what that value is, we simply apply our
rule inductively from the beginning, except to M1 as the outcome, rather than Y .

Applying the first stage of our rule gives us the potential outcome
Y (a′0 , a′1 , L1 (a′0 ), L2 (a′0 , a′1 ), γm1 , γm2 ), where γm1 and γm2 are path-specific effects of
A0 , A1 on M1 and M2 , respectively, along the green paths only. If we apply the rule
inductively γm1 , and γm2 , and plug in and simplify, we get that our path-specific effect is
the following complex potential outcome
Y (a′0 , a′1 , L1 (a′0 ), L2 (a′0 , a′1 ), M1 (a0 , L1 (a′0 )), M2 (a1 , L2 (a′1 , a′0 )))

(18)

While this expression looks algebraically complex, what it is actually expressing is a rather
simple idea. We have two treatment levels: “baseline” and “active.” For the purposes of
green paths, the causal paths we are interested in, we pretend treatment levels are active.
For the purposes of all other paths, we pretend treatment levels are baseline. In this way,
the treatment is active only along the paths we are interested in, and all other paths are
“turned off.” We use this rule to select what values we intervene on, and then use these

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

24

interventions in a nested way, following the causal paths of the graph. An equivalent
definition of path-specific effects phrased in terms of replacing structural equations is given
by Pearl (2001).
The Total Effect Decomposition Property for Path-Specific Effects
In the previous sections we defined the direct and indirect effects by taking a
difference of expectations (see equations 13 and 14). We can generalize such definitions to
path-specific effects to obtain a decomposition of the total effect into a sum of two terms,
one representing the effect along proper causal paths in π, and one representing the effect
along proper causal paths not in π.
First, assume the distribution for the nested potential outcome defining the
path-specific effect along proper causal paths in π of A on Y is given by pπ (Y ). Then we
have

Effect along paths in π = E[Y ]pπ (Y ) − E[Y (a′ )]

(19)

Effect along paths not in π = E[Y (a)] − E[Y ]pπ (Y )

(20)

and

Since the total effect can be defined as E[Y (a)] − E[Y (a′ )], we have

Total Effect = Effect along paths in π + Effect along paths not in π

which is an intuitive additivity property stating that the total effect can be
decomposed into a sum of two terms, where one term quantifies the effect operating along
a given bundle of proper causal paths π, and another term quantifies the effect operating
along all proper causal paths other than those in π. Note that this property generalizes the
additivity property for direct and indirect effects, where π was taken to mean a single
arrow from A to Y .

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

Path-Specific Effects as Functions of Observed Data

In the previous section we showed that a path-specific effect can be defined in terms
of a nested potential outcome after we “turn off” causal paths we are not interested in.
Regardless of how sensible such a definition may be, it is not very useful unless this
potential outcome can be expressed as a function of the observed data, and thus become
amenable to statistical analysis.
In a previous section, we showed that in order to express direct and indirect effects in
terms of observed data, we needed to make an untestable independence assumption (shown
in equation 15). Path-specific effects generalize direct and indirect effects, and thus require
even more assumptions.
In fact, for the path-specific effect along green paths in Fig. 3, it suffices to believe
the following independence claim for any value assignments a0 , a1 , a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 :
{Y (a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ), L1 (a′0 ), L2 (a′0 , a′1 )} ⊥
⊥ {M1 (a0 , l1 ), M2 (a0 , a1 , l2 )}

(21)

If we believe this assumption, we can express the path-specific effect in equation 18 as

X

p(Y (a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ), L1 (a′0 ) = l1 , L2 (a′0 , a′1 ) = l2 )·

(22)

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

p(M1 (a0 , l1 ) = m1 , M2 (a1 , l2 ) = m2 )

This expression is a product of terms, where each term is a well defined interventional
density (that is, there are no conflicts involving different hypothetical worlds). If we further
make use of the general theory of identification of interventional densities from observed
data (Tian & Pearl, 2002b), (Shpitser & Pearl, 2006b, 2008), we can express the above as
follows

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

26

p(Y |a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ) · p(m2 |l2 , a1 , m1 , a0 ) · p(l2 |a′0 , a′1 , l1 ) · p(m1 |l1 , a0 ) · p(l1 |a′0 )

X

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

(23)

This expression is a function of the observed data.
What is left is finding an expression for the total effect of A0 , A1 on Y . It is not
difficult to show that E[Y (a0 , a1 )] =

P

m1 ,l1

E[Y |m1 , l1 , a1 , a0 ]p(m1 , l1 |a0 ). By analogy with

a previous section, we can express the path-specific effect via fully green paths in π through
M1 , M2 as a difference of expectations
X

E[Y |a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ] · p(m2 |l2 , a1 , m1 , a0 ) · p(l2 |a′0 , a′1 , l1 ) · p(m1 |l1 , a0 ) · p(l1 |a′0 )−

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

X

E[Y |m1 , l1 , a′1 , a′0 ]p(m1 , l1 |a′0 )

m1 ,l1

(24)
while the effect via all paths that are not fully green (that is proper causal paths not in π)
as another difference

X

E[Y |m1 , l1 , a1 , a0 ]p(m1 , l1 |a0 )−

m1 ,l1

X

E[Y |a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ] · p(m2 |l2 , a1 , m1 , a0 ) · p(l2 |a′0 , a′1 , l1 ) · p(m1 |l1 , a0 ) · p(l1 |a′0 )

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

(25)
These quantities can be estimated with standard statistical methods by simply positing a
model for each term, for instance a regression model, estimating the models from data, and
computing the estimated functional. This is the so called “parametric g-formula” approach
(J. Robins, 1986). With this method, care must be taken to avoid the “null paradox” issue,
as was the case with direct and indirect effects. A less straightforward approach which only
relies on modeling the probability of the treatment in each times lice given the past, is to

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

27

generalize marginal structural models (J. M. Robins et al., 2000), which were originally
developed in the context of estimating total effects in longitudinal settings with
confounding. Another alternative is to extend existing multiply robust methods for point
treatment mediation settings (Tchetgen & Shpitser, 2012b) based on semi-parametric
statistics to the longitudinal setting.

Expressing Arbitrary Path-Specific Effects in Terms of Observed Data
One difficulty with path-specific effects is that the corresponding potential outcome
counterfactual is nested, and therefore complicated. On the other hand, the graphical
representation of path-specific effects on a causal diagram is fairly intuitive (effect along
green paths only). For this reason, it would be desirable to obtain a result which says, for a
particular bundle of green paths on a particular causal diagram, whether the corresponding
counterfactual can be expressed as a function of the observed data, without going into the
details of the counterfactual itself. In this section we give just such a result, which
generalizes existing results on path-specific effects in cases with a single treatment and no
unobserved confounding (Avin et al., 2005).
We first start with a few preliminaries on graphs. We will display causal diagrams
with unobserved confounding, such that those in Figs. 2 and 3 by means of a special kind
of mixed graph containing two kinds of edges, directed edges (→), either blue or green
depending on whether we are interested in the corresponding causal path, and red
bidirected edges (↔). The former represent direct causation edges, as before. The latter
represent the presence of some unspecified unobserved common cause. For example, we
represent the causal diagram in Fig. 3 by means of the mixed graph shown in Fig. 4. Note
that since U links three nodes, L1 , L2 , Y , each pair of these three is joined by a bidirected
arrow. We call this type of mixed graph an acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMG)
(Richardson, 2009). Verma and Pearl (1990) called these types of graphs latent projections.
The reason we use bidirected arrows is both to avoid cluttering the graph with potentially

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

28

many possible unobserved confounders, and because certain crucial definitions involving
confounders are easier to state in terms of bidirected arrows.
A sequence of distinct edges such that the first edge connects to X, the last edge
connects to Y , and each kth and k + 1th edge shares a single node in common is called a
path from X to Y . If vertices X, Y are connected by a path of the form X → . . . → Y ,
then we say X is an ancestor of Y and Y is a descendant of X. Such a path is called
directed. A path is called bidirected if it consists exclusively of bidirected edges. For an
ADMG G with a set of nodes V , we define a subgraph GA over a subset A ⊆ V of nodes to
consist only of nodes in A and edges in G with both endpoints in A. If an edge X → Y
exists, X is called a parent of Y , and Y a child of X.
Definition 1 (district) Let G be an ADMG. Then for any node a, the set of nodes in G
reachable from a by bidirected paths is called the district of a, written DisG (a).
For example, in the graph in Fig. 4, DisG (Y ) = {Y, L1 , L2 }.
Definition 2 (recanting district) Let G be an ADMG, A, Y sets of nodes in G, and π a
subset of proper causal paths which start with a node in A and end in a node in Y in G.
Let V ∗ be the set of nodes not in A which are ancestral of Y via a directed path which does
not intersect A. Then a district D in an ADMG GV ∗ is called a recanting district for the
π-specific effect of A on Y if there exist nodes zi , zj ∈ D (possibly zi = zj ), ai ∈ A, and
yi , yj ∈ Y (possibly yi = yj ) such that there is a proper causal path ai → zi → . . . → yi in π,
and a proper causal path ai → zj → . . . → yj not in π.
It turns out that the recanting district criterion characterizes situations when a
potential outcome counterfactual can be expressed in terms of well-defined interventions,
without conflicts, as long as we assume that the causal diagram represents a set of
(arbitrary) structural equations.

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

29

Theorem 3 (recanting district criterion) Let G be an ADMG representing a causal
diagram with unobserved confounders corresponding to a structural causal model. Let A, Y
sets of nodes nodes in G, and π a subset of proper causal paths which start with a node in A
and end in a node in Y in G. Then the π-specific effect of A on Y is expressible as a
functional of interventional densities if and only if there does not exists a recanting district
for this effect.

The functional referenced in the theorem is equal to

X Y

p(D = d|do(ED = eD ))

(26)

V ∗ \Y D

where D ranges over all districts in the graph GV ∗ , ED refers to nodes with directed arrows
pointing into D but which are themselves not in D, and value assignments d, eD are
assigned as follows. If any element a in A occurs in ED in a term p(D = d|do(ED = eD )),
then it is assigned a baseline value if the arrows from a to elements in D are all blue, and
an active value if the arrows from a to elements in D are all green. All other elements in
ED are assigned values consistent with the values indexed in the summation.
The proof of this theorem is given in the supplementary materials. As an example,
assume if we are interested in the effect of A0 , A1 on Y along only the green paths in the
graph in Fig. 3. The set of nodes V ∗ in this case is just {L1 , L2 , M1 , M2 , Y }. There are
three districts in the corresponding graph GV ∗ , which is just the graph obtained from Fig.
3 by removing A0 , A1 and all edges adjacent to these nodes. These three districts are
{M1 }, {M2 }, and {L1 , L2 , Y }. It is never the case that both a green and a blue arrow from
A0 or A1 points to nodes in the same district such that these nodes are ancestors of Y .
This means there is no recanting district for this effect, which in turn means the effect is
expressible as a functional of interventional densities. We have already verified this fact in
the previous section where this functional was given as equation 22, and which can be

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

30

rephrased in the do(.) notation as follows:

X

p(Y, l1 , l2 |do(a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 )) · p(m1 , m2 |do(a0 , a1 , l1 , l2 ))

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

which can be shown equals to

X

p(Y, l1 , l2 |do(a′0 , a′1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 )) · p(m1 |do(a0 , l1 )) · ·p(m2 |do(a1 , l2 ))

(27)

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

which is easily verified to be an example of equation 26.
On the other hand, in either of the graphs shown in Fig. 5, the recanting district
exists. In Fig. 5 (a), the district {L1 , L2 , M2 , Y } is recanting, since the path A1 → L2 → Y
is not fully green (e.g. we are not interested in the effect along this path), while the path
A1 → M2 → Y is fully green, and L2 and M2 lie in the same district. Similarly, in Fig. 5
(b), the district {M1 } is recanting, since the path A0 → M1 → L2 → Y is not fully green,
while the path A0 → M1 → Y is fully green, and M1 is its own district.
The recanting district criterion generalizes an earlier result for static treatments and
no unobserved confounding known as a recanting witness, where the “witness” is a
singleton node (Avin et al., 2005). The term is “recanting” because for the purposes of one
path from a particular treatment Ak the witness (or district in our case) pretends the
treatment should be active, while for the purposes of another path from that same
treatment Ak the witness (or district) “changes the story,” and pretends the treatment
should be baseline. Identification of path-specific effects in terms of interventional
distributions must always avoid this “recanting” phenomenon. Note that even in the case
of multiple longitudinal treatments, the “recanting” phenomenon still involves a single
treatment, but spoils the identification of the whole effect of multiple treatments.
The presence of the recanting district prevents the expression of path-specific effects
in terms of either observed or interventional data in the sense that it is possible to
construct two distinct causal models which are observationally and interventionally

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

31

indistinguishable, which are represented by the same causal diagram, but which disagree on
the value of the path-specific effect. Furthermore, if the recanting district criterion does not
exist, it is possible to characterize cases in which the expression for the path-specific effect
in terms of interventional densities can be further expressed in terms of observational data.
Theorem 4 Let G be an ADMG with nodes V representing a causal diagram with
unobserved confounders corresponding to a structural causal model. Let A, Y sets of nodes
nodes in G, and π a subset of proper causal paths which start with a node in A and end in a
node in Y in G. Assume there does not exist a recanting district for the π-specific effect of
A on Y . Then the counterfactual representing the π-specific effect of A on Y is expressible
in terms of the observed data p(V ) if and only if the total effect p(y|do(a)) is expressible in
terms of p(V ). Moreover, the functional of p(V ) equal to the counterfactual is obtained
from equation (26) by replacing each interventional term in (26) by a functional of the
observed data identifying that term given by Tian’s identification algorithm (Tian & Pearl,
2002a),(Shpitser & Pearl, 2006b, 2008).
General theory of identification of causal effects states that if p(y|do(a)) is identifiable
in terms of observed data, then it can be expressed as the functional very similar to that in
equation (26), except all variables in A are assigned “active values” a. If p(y|do(a)) is
identifiable from observed data, then each of the interventional terms in the functional is
expressible in terms of observed data. This theorem simply states that to obtain our
path-specific effect all we have to do is obtain the functional of the observed data
expressing p(y|do(a)), and replace the appropriate “active values” a by “baseline values” a′
in those terms of the functional which correspond to districts containing children of
treatment A via blue arrows. For example, it can be shown that the total effect
p(y|do(a0, a1 )) in Fig. 3 is equal to
X

p(Y |a0 , a1 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2 ) · p(m2 |l2 , a1 , m1 , a0 ) · p(l2 |a0 , a1 , l1 ) · p(m1 |l1 , a0 ) · p(l1 |a0 )

l1 ,l2 ,m1 ,m2

(28)

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

32

Replacing a0 and a1 by a′0 and a′1 in expressions for Y , L1 and L2 (which are the only
terms where the node before the conditioning bar is a child of A0 or A1 along blue arrows)
yields precisely equation (23) which is the function of the observed data equal to the
path-specific effect.
Corollary 5 (generalized mediation formula for path-specific effects) Let G be an
ADMG with nodes V representing a causal diagram with unobserved confounders
corresponding to a structural causal model. Let A be a set of nodes, Y a single node in G,
and π a subset of proper causal paths which start with a node in A and end in Y in G.
Assume there does not exist a recanting district for the π-specific effect of A on Y . Assume
p(y|do(a)) is expressible as a functional fdo(a) (p(V )) of the observed data, and the
path-specific effect is equal to the functional fπ (p(V )) obtained in Theorem 4. Then the
path-specific effect along the set of paths π on the mean difference scale for active value a
and baseline value a′ is equal to

Effect along paths in π = E[Y ]fπ (p(V )) − E[Y ]fdo(a′ ) (p(V ))
while the path-specific effect along all paths not in π on the mean difference scale is equal to

Effect along paths not in π = E[Y ]fdo(a) (p(V )) − E[Y ]fπ (p(V ))

An example of the generalized mediation formula applied to the longitudinal
mediation setting shown in Fig. 3 is shown in equation (24) for the direct effect, and
equation (25) for the indirect effect. The proof of these assertions is also given in the
supplementary materials.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have shown that existing methods for mediation analysis in
epidemiology and psychology literature based on the product and difference methods (Judd

LONGITUDINAL MEDIATION ANALYSIS

33

& Kenny, 1981),(Baron & Kenny, 1986) and linear regression models suffer from problems
in the presence of interactions, non-linearities, binary outcomes, unobserved confounders,
and other modeling complications. We have described a general framework developed in
the causal inference literature based on potential outcome counterfactuals, non-parametric
structural equations, and causal diagrams which recovers the product and difference
methods as a special case, but which is flexible enough to handle multiple types of
difficulties which arise in practical mediation analysis situations.
Our paper serves two aims. We first wish to caution against careless use of mediation
methodology based on linear regressions in situations where such methodology is not
suitable. Such careless use may invalidate any conclusions about mediation that are drawn.
Second, we want to show that appropriate use of functional models and potential outcomes
is a very flexible strategy for tackling complex questions in causal inference, including
mediation questions in longitudinal settings with unobserved confounding. We demonstrate
this flexibility by developing a complete characterization of situations when path-specific
effects are expressible as functionals of the observed data. This result paves the way for
using statistical tools for answering general mediation questions in longitudinal
observational studies. We argue that methods based on functional models and potential
outcomes are often a more appropriate methodology in complex mediation setting than
simpler methods based on linear structural equations.
