any of the exponential number of extensions of obser­

merely on a small number of them would work. In this

models a small fraction of all possible states to account
for most of the total probability space.

Some Properties of Joint Probability Distributions

2.2

STATE PROBABILITIES

Let us choose at random one state of a model that con­
sists of n variables X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xn. We choose
this state equiprobably from among all possible states,
regardless of its probability. One way of imagining this
is that we are drawing a marble out of a basket contain­
ing uniquely marked but otherwise identical marbles.
As a state is an instantiation of each of the model's
n variables, another way of looking at this selection
process is that we are traversing the probability tree
representing the model from its root to one of its leaves
taking at each step one of the possible branches with
equal probability. This amounts to a random choice
of one outcome from among the outcomes of each of
the variables. For example, we might randomly select
one of the four states in the model of Figure 1 by first
choosing one of the two possible outcomes of the vari­
able disease by flipping a coin (let the outcome be for
example d) and then choosing one of the two possible
outcomes of the variable test by flipping a coin again
(let this outcome be for example t). Our procedure
made selection of each state equiprobable (with prob­
ability 0. 25 in our example). The probability p of a
selected state is equal to the product of conditionals
of each of the randomly selected outcomes. It is equal
for our selected state to p Pr(d, t) Pr(d)Pr(tld).
In general, if we denote Pi to be the conditional (or
prior) probability of the randomly selected outcome of
variable X;, we have
=

P

i=l

(1)

In random selection of a state, we chose each Pi to
be one number from among the probabilities of vari­
ous outcomes of variable X;. We can, therefore, view
each Pi as a random variable taking equiprobable val­
ues from among the probabilities of the outcomes of
variable X;. Of course, the distribution of p; is not
in general independent from the distribution of p1,
i 1' j, as the outcomes of some variables may impact
the conditional probability distributions of other vari­
ables. Selection of Pi within its distribution, however,
is independent of any other pj, i # j. Note that in
our simple example we used outcomes of independent
coin tosses to choose a state. Intuitively, if the model
is causal, then even though the mode in which a mech­
anism is working, described by a conditional probabil­
ity distribution, depends on the outcomes of its causal
ancestors, the exact form of this distribution (i.e., the
values of probabilities of different outcomes) is a prop­
erty of the mechanism and is independent on anything
else in the system.
Having described the process of randomly drawing a
state as above, can we say anything meaningful about
the distribution of p? It turns out that we can say
quite a lot about a simple transformation of p. By
taking the logarithm of both sides of (1), we obtain

ent distribution. The asymptotic behavior of a sum of
random variables is relatively well understood and ad­
dressed by a class of limit theorems known collectively
as central limit theorem. When the number of compo­
nents of the sum approaches infinity, the distribution
of the sum approaches normal distribution, regardless
of the probability distributions of the individual com­
ponents. Even though in any practical case we will be
dealing with a finite number of variables, the theorem
gives a good approximation even when the number of
variables is small.
2.3

CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM:
"ORDER OUT OF CHAOS"

Central limit theorem (CLT) is one of the fundamen­
tal and most robust theorems of statistics, applica­
ble to a wide range of distributions. It was originally
proposed for Bernoulli variables, then generalized to
independent identically distributed variables, then to
non-identically distributed, and to some cases where
independence is violated. Extending the boundaries
of distributions to which CLT is applicable is one of
active areas of research in statistics. CLT is so ro­
bust and surprising that it is sometimes referred to as
"order out of chaos" (de Finetti, 1974).
One of the most general forms of CLT is due to Lia­
pounov (to be found in most statistics textbooks).
Theorem 1

Let X1, X2, X3, ... , Xn be a sequence of
independent random variables such that E(Xi) J-ti,
E((X;- J-t;)2) =crt, and E(IX;- J-t;l3) wr all exist
for every i. Then their sum, Y = L:�=1 Xi is asymp­
totically distributed as N(E�=l J-ti, E�=l crJ), provided

textbooks).

Returning to Equation (2), we have by the CLT, that
assuming that the preconditions of CLT are satisfied,
the sum on the right side is in the limit normally dis­

must be drawn from a lognormal distribution.

demonstrate that these conditions are reasonably sat­
isfied in the process of constructing a joint probability
distribution. I will argue that the type of process that
we are dealing with is one that is addressed by the
theorem.
In what follows, I will be studying the properties of the
logarithm of the distribution rather than the distribu­
tion itself. This is motivated by a practical consid­
eration - the lognormal distributions resulting from
the application of the CLT tend to span over many
orders of magnitude and are extremely skewed. Loga­
rithmic scale can be most appreciated in the diagrams
that will be shown later in the paper - the skewness
of the distributions makes diagrams drawn in linear
scale practically unreadable. Changing the scale be­
tween logarithmic and linear is straightforward.

Several important qualitative properties of this func­
tion are determined purely by its form. As E:1 af
is positive, the function is shifted with respect to
f(lnp) by E7=l a? towards higher values of proba­
bilities. This shift depends on both the number of
variables in the model and the individual variances in
probabilities: it is stronger for distributions with high
variance (i.e., distributions that show stronger asym­
metries in probabilities of various outcomes). The
contribution function reaches its maximum for higher
probabilities than the distribution of probabilities of
states. (Exactly for lnp = E7=1 1--li + E7= 1 az or for

EXAMPLE: ALARM

Given the strength of the conclusions of the theoret­
ical analysis, it might be useful to study the prop­
erties of the joint p robability distribution over a real
model. The most realistic model with a full numerical

specification that was available to me was ALARM,
a medical diagnost ic model of monitoring anesthesia

patients in inten si ve care units (Beinlich et al., 1989).
With its 38 random variables, each having two or three

outcomes, ALARM has a computationally prohibitive
number of states. I selec ted , therefore, several self­
contained subsets of ALARM consisting of 7 to 13
variables, and analyzed the distribution of probabil­
ities of all states within those subsets.

typical

uncertain domain, I have demonstrated that the joint
probability distribution over its variables is created by
a multiplicative process, combining conditional prob­

abilities of individual variables. Asymmetries in these

individual distributions, which I argued can be ex­

pected because of stru ct ural properties of models, re­
sult in joint probability distributions exhibiting or­
ders of magnitude differences in probabilities of var­

ious states of the model. In particular , there is usually

a small fraction of states

that

cover a large portion of

the total probability space with the remaining states
having practically ne gligible p robability.

Even though I referred to mo dels as wholes, the asym­
metries derived in the preceding sections will hold for

their self-contained parts. Having a large probabilistic

model, we can at each reasoning step determine what,
if anything, is relevant for a given query.4 If this se­
lected part contains random variables, it is amenable
to our argument.
The analysis contained in this paper concerns static
systems. I believe, however, that the essential ar­
gument is easily transferable into dynamic systems.
Note, that to model a transition of a system over time,
we can replace each variable X in a static model by
additional variables Xt, specifying the state of X at
time ti. The value of variable Xt, can be specified by
a probability distribution conditional on the values of
variables Xt1, j < i. Then, it is straightforward to ex­
tend the argument to all newly introduced variables in
the way I did for static systems.
Two special classes of interest are variables with sym­
metric probability distributions, such as the outcomes
of die tosses, and deterministic variables. If all of the
variables in a model had symmetric distributions or all
of them were deterministic, then the denominator of
(3) would be zero. Clearly, the argument will hold as
long as there is a sufficient number of variables that be­
long to the complement of these two classes. Variables
with symmetric distributions simply tend to shift the
distribution of the probability mass towards lower val­
ues, decreasing the expected contributions of the most
likely states, while deterministic variables achieve the
opposite.
The significance of this analysis is that it provides a
clarification for what has been long assumed but never,
to my knowledge, explicated. By providing a frame­
work for studying the distribution of probabilities of
individual states in the joint probability distribution,
this analysis provides foundations for one direction of
research on approximate reasoning schemes that are
correct and yet computationally tractable. The ob­
served and theoretically derived asymmetry in the dis­
tribution of probabilities of individual states of the
model suggests that considering only a small number
of them can lead to good approximations in belief up­
dating. One possible reasoning scheme might consist
of considering most probable states within a relevant
subset of the network until the sum of the probabilities
of the remaining states is below a small error thresh­
old E. Incorporation of utility considerations into such
algorithm and converting it into a normatively cor­
rect decision procedure is straightforward (Druzdzel,
1993). A crucial issue in such a computation is con­
trolling for precision so that atypical symmetric mod­
els lead merely to loss of efficiency but not to incor­
rect posterior beliefs or inferior decisions. This can
be accomplished by fitting a lognormal distribution to
the joint probability distribution and computing the
expectations based on this distribution, as shown in
Section 3.2.

methods for determining relevance in the context of BBNs.
