This paper presents and discusses several methods
for reasoning from inconsistent knowledge bases.
A so-called argumentative-consequence relation,
taking into account the existence of consistent
arguments in favor of a conclusion and the
absence of consistent arguments in favor of its
contrary, is particularly investigated. Flat
knowledge bases, i.e. without any priority
between their elements, as well as prioritized ones
where some elements are considered as m ore
strongly entrenched than others are studied under
d i f f e r e n t consequence relations. L astly a
paraconsistent-like treatment of prioritized
knowledge bases is proposed, where both the level
of entrenchment and the level of paraconsistency
attached to a formula are propagated. The priority
levels are handled in the framework of possibility
theory.

1. Introduction
One of the emerging important problems pertaining to the
management of knowledge-based systems is inconsistency
handling. Inconsistency may be present for several
reasons: the presence of general rules with exceptions, the
existence of several possibly disagreeing sources feeding
the knowledge base are among the most common ones.
There are two attitudes in front of inconsistent knowledge.
One is to revise the knowledge base and restore
consistency. The other is to cope with inconsistency. The
first approach meets two difficulties: there are several
ways of restoring inconsistency yielding different results,
and the problem is that part of the information is thrown
away and we no longer have access to it. Coping with
inconsistency bypasses these difficulties. However we must
take a step beyond classical logic, since the presence of
inconsistency enables anything to be entailed from a set of
formulas.
This paper investigates several methods for coping with
inconsistency by suitable notions of consequence capable
of inferring non-trivial conclusions from an inconsistent
knowledge base. These consequence relationships coincide
with the classical definition when the knowledge base is
consistent. When the knowledge base is flat, i.e. made of

equally reliable propositional formulas, the proposal made
by Rescher and Manor [21] is very commonly used
nowadays: compute the set of maximal consistent subsets
of the knowledge base first, then a formula is accepted as
a consequence when it can be classically inferred from all
maximal consistent subsets of propositions or from at
least one maximal consistent subset.
However the first consequence relation is very
conservative hence rather unproductive while the latter is
too permissive may leads to pairs of mutually exclusive
conclusions. A mild inference approach is proposed in this
paper, that is more productive than the first consequence
relation but do not lead to conclusions which are pairwise
contradictory. It is based on the idea of arguments that
goes back to Toulmin [25] and is related to previous
proposals [19], [18], and [24] that were suggested in the
framework of defeasible reasoning for handling exceptions.
We suggest that a COtlclusion can be inferred from an
inconsistent knowledge base if the latter contains an
argument that supports this conclusion, but no argument
that supports its negation.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 deals with flat
k n o w l e d g e b a s e s a n d c o m pares s e veral notion s o f
consequence relations that are inconsistency-tolerant,
including several ones that come from the non-monotonic

logic literature. Section 3 contains a thorough analysis of
our argumentative inference process. Section 4 extends the
argumentative inference to layered knowledge bases where
layers express degrees of certainty as in possibilistic logic
[10]; it refines the flat case by allowing for pieces of
information of various levels. Section 5 deals with a
paraconsistent-like treatment of layered inconsistent
knowledge bases, whereby a formula carries two weights:
its degree of certainty and the degree of certainty of its
negation. Lastly a new way of combining knowledge bases
issued from several sources is suggested, inspired by the
argumentative inference. Results are given without proofs
due to space limitations. Proofs appear in the full report.

For the sake of simplicity, we consider in this paper only
a finite propositional language denoted by;£.,. We denote

412

Benferhat,

Dubois, and Prade

the set of classical interpretations by n, by t- the
classical consequence relation. Let I. be a set of
propositional formulas, possibly inconsistent but not
deductively closed. OJ:D denotes the deductive closure of I..
i.e.en(I.)={<!>e �, I. t- 4>}. W e also a s s ume that t h e
knowledge bases manipulated in this section are flat, which
means that all formulas in I. have the same reliability.

From now on, we denote by Inc(I.) the set of
propositions belonging to at least one minimal
inconsistent sub-base of I., namely:
Inc(I.) = {4>, 3 I.i � I., such that <1> e I.i and I.i is
minimal inconsistent}

We now introduce the notion of argument:

The set Inc(I.) is somewhat related to the "base of
nogoods" used in the terminology of the ATMS[12].
Once Inc(I.) is computed, we remove from I. all elements
of Inc(I.), the result base is called the free base of I,,
denoted by Free(I.) [2]. In other words, Free(I.) contains
all formulae which are not involved in any inconsistency
of the knowledge base L. Now, let us introduce the
notion of theFree consequence, denoted by t-Free:

Def. 2: A sub-base Li of L is said to be an argument
for a formula 4>, if it satisfies the following conditions:
(i) I.i¥- .l, (ii) I.it-4>, and (iii) \i'Jfe Li, I.i-{'1'}¥- 4>.

Def. 5: A formula <1> is said to be a free consequence (or a
sound consequence) of I., denoted by I.t-�, iff 4> i s
logically entailed fromFree(L). i.e. LI-Ftre<!> iffFree(I.)t-4>

Notice that this notion of argument is identical to the one
proposed in [24] and is also very similar to the notion of
environment used in the terminology of the ATMS [12].

TheFree-inference relation is very conservative as we will
later. Let us now recall the approach first proposed in
[21]. Let I. be a possibly inconsistent base, MC(I.) be
the set of all maximal consistent sub-bases of I.. The
universal (called also the inevitable) consequence relation
is defined in [21] in this way:

Def.l: A sub-base I.i of I. is said to be consistent if it
is not possible to deduce a contradiction from I.i, and is
said to be maximally consistent if adding any formula 4>
from I.-I.i to I. i produces the inconsistency of I.iu{<1>}.

Def. 3: A formula 4> is said to be an argumentative
consequence of I., denoted by L t- �<!>. if and only if:
(i) there exists an argument for <1> in I., and
(ii) there is no argument for -,cj> in I..

As a consequence of this defmition, if our knowledge base
contains only the two contradictory statements {<!>.-.<!>}
then the inference <!>A-.<!>t-bi 'I' does not hold. In other
words, our approach is in agreement with the idea of
paraconsistent logics [6], where they reject the principle
"ex absurdo quodlibet" which allows the deduction of any
formula from an inconsistent base.
It is easy to verify that t- bi is non-monotonic.
Moreover, if I. is consistent then I.t-4> iff I.t-8't.<l>· It
means that the non-monotonicity only appears in the
presence of inconsistency, and the argumentative
consequence resorts to what Satoh [23] calls "lazy non­
monotonic reasoning", an idea also proposed in [15].
2.2. Comparative Study o f Inconsistency­
Tolerant Consequence Relations

In this sub-section we compare our approach to reasoning
in the presence of inconsistency to the ones reviewed in
[3]. We start this comparative study by presenting the
different approaches from the most conservative ones to
the most adventurous ones.But first we need some further
definitions:
Def. 4: A sub-base I.i of I. is said to be minimal
inconsistent if and only if it satisfies the two following
requirements: (i) Lit-.l, and (ii)\i <1> E Li, I.i-{4>}¥- .l.

see

Def. 6: A formula <1> is said to be a universal
consequence or Me-consequence of L, denoted by Lt-V$,
iff <1> is entailed from each element of MC(L), namely:
I. 1- \i <I> iff \i Li E MC(I.), Li 1- <I>
As it has been mentioned above, the Free consequence
relation is more conservative than Me-consequence:
Proposition 1: Each Free-consequence is also a Me­
consequence. The converse is false.

One way of finding the proof of the previous proposition
is to notice that:
Free(I.) = ni.i e MC(I.) Li
since if a formula <1> does not belong to Free(L) then there
exists a minimal inconsistent sub-base I.k containing 4>,
and therefore there exists at least one maximally
consistent sub-base which contains Lk but not 4>, which
means that there exists at least one element of MC(L)
which does not contain 4>, and consequently 4> does not
belong to the intersection of the elements of Me(L). The
converse is also true. Indeed, if <!>eo n L iE MC(I,)Li then
there exists a sub-base Li such that c�>e: Li. and LiU{4>} is
inconsistent, therefore 4> is not free. Then from the
properties of en, we find:
en(Free(I.))=Cn(ni.i e MC(I.)I.i)�n i. ie MC(I.)Cn(I.i).
The next propositions compare the Me-consequence to
the argumentative consequence:

413

Argumentative inference in uncertain and inconsistent knowledge bases

Proposition 2: A formula ell is an argumentative
consequence of I. iff (i) 3 Li E MC(I.), such that Li f-

cj>, and (ii) :ji.j e MC(I.), such that I.j f- --,cp.

Proposition 3: Each Me-consequence of I. is also an

argumentative consequence of I.. The converse is false

One of the main drawbacks of Me-consequence is the
number of elements in MC(I.) which increases
exponentially with the the number of conflicts in t he
base and in general, it is not possible to take into account
all the elements of MC(I.). In [9], it is proposed to select
a non-empty subset of MC(I.), denoted by Lex(I.), and
computed in the following manner:
Li E Lex(I,) iff 'V I. j E MC(I.), I'L.il � I'L.jl
where II.I is the cardinality of I.. This ordering is called
the lexicographical ordering, and corresponds to the
property of parsimony advocated in diagnostic problems
[20]. A probabilistic justification ofLex(I,) can be found
in [3].
In order to generate the set of plausible inferences based
onLex(I,) from an inconsistent knowledge base, we use a
defmition similar to the Me-consequence:

Def. 8: A formula 4> is said to be an existential
consequence of I., denoted by I. f- 3«1>, iff there exists at

least one element of MC(I.) which entails cj>, namely:
iff
3 Li E MC(L.). Li f-3 4>
L f- 3 4>
It is not hard to see that this approach is the most
adventurous one, but unfortunately it has an important
drawback, since this approach may lead to inconsistent set
of results. Indeed, there may exists Li f- cj> and Ljf--,cj>,
in which case both cj> and -,cj> will be deduced.
The following hierarchy summarizes the links existing
between the different consequence relations studied here,
the edge means the inclusion-set relation between the set
of results generated by each inference relation. The top of
the diagram thus corresponds to the most conservative
inferences. All inferences reduce to the classical one when
I. is consistent.
Figure 1: A comparative study of inference relations

Def. 7: A formula cj> is said to be a Lex-consequence of

L., denoted by Lf- Lex<!>. iff it is entailed from each
element ofLex(I,), namely:
'V Li E Lex(I,), Li f- cj>
I. f-Lex 4>
iff
Proposition 4: Each Me-consequence of I. is also a
Lex-consequence of I.. The converse is false.

Argumentative-Consequence
I-A

TheLex-consequence and argumentative consequence are
not comparable as we see in the following example:
Example Let I.={A, ...,Bv...,A, B, ...,ev...,A, e, ...,AvD}
We have Lex('L.)={ {--,Bv--,A, B, --.Cv-,A, C, --,AvD} }.
Then -,A is a Lex-consequence of I. while it is not an
argumentative consequence, since A is also present in L..
In contrast, D is an argumentative consequence (it
derives from {A, --,Av D}) while it is not a Lex­
consequence.
TheLex-consequence may appear as an arbitrary selection
from MC(L.) if we consider a semantic point of view.
Namely, the following situation may happen:
LiELex(I,), LjE MC(I,)-Lex(I.) and one may define Lk
logically equivalent to I. j but II.ki>I'L. i l. However all
introduced consequence relations are syntax-sensitive since
L. is not closed. Yet, the counterexample demonstrates
that the Lex-consequence may implicitly delete some
useful pieces of knowledge (here A). It may result in
destroying some arguments, as well as some rebuttals
(i.e. formulas whose presence ensure an argument for --,cj>
that inhibits arguments for cj>).
Another definition of the consequence relation, called
existential relation is also proposed in [21], namely:

Proposition 5 (failure of AND): We may have L.

9t,

<j>, I. f- 9t, ljl, and not I. 1- 9t, 4> A 'I'·
Proposition 5 must not be seen as a major drawback of
f- 9t, since in some cases we do not want to have the
AND property. The f- 9t, consequence relation captures
the cases when we believe in two mutually consistent
properties of some object for conflicting reasons.
Proposition 6: f- 9t, satisfies the property of Right

An important issue when reasoning with an inconsistent
knowledge base L. is whether it is possible to construct
some equivalent consistent base such that plausible
inferences from L. are its logical consequences. In this
section we try to construct such an equivalent knowledge
base using the argumentative inference relation.
Propositions 5 and 6 are very important to characterise the
set of argumentative consequences of a knowledge base L,
denoted by Cnc9't(L.); Cnc9't(L.)={c)l, L.1-c9't cjl}. The fact
that the argumentative consequence is not closed under
conjunction means that Cnc9't (L) is generally not equal to
its closure under Cn , namely: Cnc9't(L) "#- Cn(Cnc9't(L))
In this section, we assume that we use only the finite set
of propositional symbols appearing in the base L..
Def. 9: A formula q, is said to be a prime implicate of

L with respect to the argumentative inference relation if
and only if:(i) Ll-c9't q,, (ii) �q,·, such that cjl\--cjl a n d

Ll-c9'tc)l'
A prime implicate can be inferred from a maximal
consistent subset of L. However, if LiE MC(L), then the
conjunction of formulas in Li (also denoted by Li) is not
a prime implicate since it can be defeated by other
maximal consistent subsets of L. Indeed, V i"#j, Lii-•Lj.
The construction of prime implicates can be achieved from
the semantical point view. Indeed, let [Lil be the set of
models of the maximal consistent sub-base Li· A given
model <pL,i of [Lil can be viewed as a formula composed
of the conjunction of literals it satisfies. Then it can be
shown that the following expression is a prime implicate:

i

<pllV· · .Vq>I,i-l V L Vq>I.i+l V· · ·Vq>I,n
Moreover, if each maximal consistent sub-base is
complete (i.e. Vae :£,, either aE Li or -.aE LV there exists
exactly one prime implicate, and in this case the
argumentative consequence and MC-consequence are
equivalent. But in general, the prime implicates can be
numerous.
Let R1, .. Rn be the set of prime implicates of L., then
Cn�) can be seen as the union of the deductive closure of
..

each Ri under Cn, namely: Ch3t(L)=Cn(RI)u...uCn<Rn)
And it is easy to check that V i, j = l ,n L ¥ c9't Ri "Rj
Examples
(1) let L = {-,A v B, A v C, A, -,A}.
We have two maximal consistent sub-bases,
Ll={-,AvB, AvC, A}, L2={--.AvB, AvC, -,A}
Then:
[Ll]={AABAC, AABA-,C}
[L2]={-,AABAC, -,A/\-,BAC},
Therefore we have four prime implicates:
Rt=BA(CvA), R2=(AAB)v(-,BACA-,A)
R3=CA(-.AvB), R.t=(-,A/\C)v(-,CAAAB)
(2) Consider now L as:

1:, = {-,A v B, A v B, A, -,A, C}.
We have two maximal consistent sub-bases,
Lt=hAvB, AvB, A,C}, L2={-.AvB, AvB, -,A, C}
Then:
rLI]={AABAC}, [LiJ={-,AABAC}
The maximal consistent sub-bases are complete,
therefore we have only one prime implicate:
R=(AABAC)v(-,AABAC)=BAC
Then:
Cnc9't(L) = Cn({B "C})

Let us now justify why the previous definition makes
sense only if we restrict ourselves to the propositional
symbols appearing in the knowledge base. Indeed, let us
consider the following example L= {A,-.A}, we have only
one prime implicate, the tautology T, and therefore it is
not possible to deduce Av B from Cn(T) which is an
argumentative consequence of the knowledge base.
The situation: 'L l-,s4,R i, 'L 1-c9't R j and L¥ c9't R iARj
can correspond to two cases: (i) No argument supporting
RiARj can be found. In that case the arguments Li and Lj
supporting R i and Rj respectively are inconsistent.
Indeed, if L iULj is consistent then LiULji-RiARj and
there would exist an argument supporting Ri AR j; (ii)
There is an argument for -.Riv-,RjAnyway the arguments supporting the prime implicates
can be viewed as a set of scenarii extracted from L, that
express different points of views on what is the actual
information contained in L.. These points of view are
incompatible in the sense that the subsets L i and Lj
supporting two prime implicates Ri and Rj should not be
mixed (even if not inconsistent). The fact that Cnc9't (L)
still reflects conflicts lying in L, can be seen as follows:
the argumentative inference forbids that two prime
implicates Ri and Rj be inconsistent. However the set
{ R1, . . , Rn } can be globally inconsistent, namely one
argumentative consequence of L can be defeated by other
consequences grouped together.
.

Example
Consider the set L.=[-,A, -.B, A, B, -,Cv-.D, -.AvB}
The maximal consistent subsets of L are:
Ll = {-,A, -,B, -,C v -,D, -,A v B}
L 2 ={-.A, B, -,C v -.D, -,A v B}
L3 = {A, B, -.C v -.D, -.A v B}
L4 = {-,B, A, -.C v -,D}
Consider the three formulas:
c)l}=(-,A/\-,B A (-,Cv-,D)) v (-,CADA(AvB))
c)l2=(-,A/\BA(-,Cv-,D))v(CA-,D A (A v -,B))
c)l3=(AABA(-,Cv-,D))v(-,CA-,DA(-,A v -,B))
It is easy to see that L ll-c)IJ, L21-c)l2 and L31-c)l3,

Argumentative inference in uncertain and inconsistent knowledge bases

This result can be viewed as a weakness of the
argumentative inference which avoids obvious direct
contradictions, but does not escape hidden ones. It
confmns the fact that Cn� (I,) is a heterogeneous set of
properties that pertain to distinct views of the world. This
means that a question-answering system whereby a
question "is it true that cj>" is answered by yes or no after
computing I. f-� ¢1 is not really informative enough.
The system must also supply the argument for cj>. This
way of coping with inconsistency looks natural,and the
arguments for cj> and 'I' should enable the user to decide
whether these two plausible conclusions can be accepted
together or not.
4. Arguments in prioritized knowledge
bases

The use of priorities among formulas is very important to
appropriately revise inconsistent knowledge bases. For
instance, it is proved in [14] that any revision process
that satisfies natural requirements is implicitly based on
such a set of priorities. Similarly a proper treatment of
default rules also leads to prescribe priority levels, e.g.[16].
In these two cases, the handling of priorities has been
shown to be completely in agreement with possibilistic
logic [10], [2]. Arguments of different levels are also
manipulated in [13] in a way completely consistent with
possibilistic logic.
In the prioritized case, a knowledge base can be viewed as
a layered knowledge base 'L=B1 u... u B n, such that
formulas in Bi have the same level of priority or certainty
and are more reliable than the ones in Bj where j > i. This
stratification is modelled by attaching a weight a e [0,1]
to each formula with the convention that (cj> <Xi) e Bi, Vi
and a1 = 1 > a 2 > > <Xn > 0.
. . .

A sub-base

Li= E1 u .. uEn of 'L = B1 u... uBn where
V j 1,n, Ej�B j is said to be consistent if: 'Li¥- l. and is
said to be maximal consistent if adding any formula from
(I.-'Li) to Li produces an inconsistent knowledge base.
.

=

Before introducing the notion of argument in prioritized
knowledge base, let us define the notion of entailment in
a layered base, named 1t-entailment:
Def. 10: Let I. = B1 u... uBn be a layered knowledge

base. A formula cj> is said to be a 1t-consequence of I.
with weight <Xi, denoted by I. f-1t (4> <Xi). if and only if:
(i)
B1 u. .. uBi is consistent, and
Btu... uBif- cj>
(ii)
V j <i, B1 u.. u Bj ¥- cj>
(iii)
.

The definition of f-1t is identical to the one proposed in
possibilistic logic [7], [8], [10]. It is clear that in the
presence of inconsistency the 1t-entailment and the

415

classical entailment have not the same behaviour. Indeed
in classical logic if our base I. is inconsistent then any
formula can be deduced from I. and the base becomes
useless. In a stratified base, the situation is better since it
is possible to use only a consistent subbase of I. (in
general not maximal), denoted by 1t(L), induced by the
levels of priority and defined in this way:
1t(L) = B1 u ... uBi, such that 1t(L) is consistent and
Btu .. uB i+l is inconsistent
.

The remaining sub-base I. 1t(L) is simply inhibited. It
is not hard to check that the following result holds:
iff
1t('L) f- c1>
I. f-1t c1>
-

However, this way of dealing with inconsistency is not
entirely satisfactory, since it suffers from a principal
drawback named "drowning problem" in [3], as we can
see in the following examples:
Examples:
Let I. be the following stratified knowledge base:
L = {{-,A v -,B}, {A}, {B}, {C}}
This notation of the form {B1, B2, ..., Bn}, where
the weights are omitted is used for the sake of
simplicity. This base is of course inconsistent, and
only the subset Li = {{-.A v -.B}, {A} } is kept, and
therefore C cannot be deduced despite the fact that C
is outside the conflict.
A particular case of the drowning effect is called
"blocking property inheritance" [16]; [2]. This can be
illustrated by the following set of stratified defaults:
'L= {{p}, {-,p v b, -.p v -.f}, {-,b v f,-,b v w}}
where p, b, f and w means respectively penguin, bird,
fly and wings. From this base it is not possible for a
penguin to inherit properties of birds (in our example
to inherit property of having wings), while the only
undesirable property for a penguin is "flying".
•

•

One way of solving the drowning problem is to recover
the inhibited free defaults, denoted by IFree(I,), and
defined in this way:
IFree('L) = Free(I,) n (L -1t(L))
Then once the inhibited free set has been computed, we
define the new inference relation in this way:
Def. 11: A formula cj> is said to be a 1t+Free­
consequence of I., iff it is logically entailed from 1t('L)u
IFree(I,), namely: Lf-1t+freecl> iff 1t('L)uiFree('L.)f-cj>
Proposition 7: Each 1t-consequence of I. is also a
1t+Free-consequence of I..

Brewka [4] (see also [22]) has proposed a more
adventurous approach to reason with inconsistent and
layered knowledge bases, the idea is to take advantage of
the stratification of the base to rank -order the maximal
consistent sub-bases of I. and keep only the best ones,
namely the "so-called preferred sub-bases".

416

Benferhat, Dubois, and Prade

Let L = B1 u ... u B n be a layered knowledge base. A
preferred sub-base Li is constructed by starting with a
maximal consistent sub-base of B 1, then we add to Li as
many formulas of Bz as possible (wrt to consistency
criterion),and so on. Formally,Li is a preferred sub-base
of I. if it can be con' s tructed as f ollows:
Lj=E l uEzu...uEn .where 'V j = 1 ,n, E1 u Ez u ... uEj
is a maximal consistent sub-base of B 1 u Bzu...uB j.
Preferred subbases have also been independently
introduced in [9] in the setting of possibilistic logic under
the name of strongly maximal consistent subbases. They
are such that Lju{(cj> a.)}t--n(.l a.), 'V(cj> a.)e L-Li·
Def. 12: Let Pref(I.) be the set of preferred sub-bases of
I.. A formula cj> is said to be a preferred consequence of I.,
denoted by Lt--preflll. iff it is entailed from each element
of Pref(I.), namely: Lt--preflll iff 'VI.i E Pref(I.),Lit--e!>
Proposition 8: Each 1t+Free-consequence of L is also
a preferred consequence of I.. The converse is false
The Lex-consequence relation described in the case of flat
knowledge bases has also been proposed in the case of
stratified knowledge bases [9]. The objective is to reduce
the number of elements of Pref(I.), by selecting the
elements which satisfy the following requirement:
Li=E1u...uEneLex(I.) iff 'V I.j=E'1u ...uE'n ePref(I.),
li, such that IE'i i>IEil and 'V j<i IE'ji=IEjl
The definition of Lex-consequence is identical to the one
presented in the case of a flat knowledge base,namely a
formula cj> is a Lex-consequence of L if and only if it is
entailed from each element of Lex(I.).
Proposition 9: Each preferred-consequence of L is also
a Lex-consequence of I.. The converse is false.
Now,we propose to extend the argumentative inference to
layered knowledge bases, and to compare it with the
inferences proposed above.
Def. 13: A sub-base Li of L is said to be an argument
for a formula cj> with a weight a. if it satisfies the
following conditions: (i) Li ¥ .l, (ii) Li 1---1t
- (cj> a.), and
(iii)'V(Ijl J3) E Li. Li- {('I' f3)} ¥ 1t (cj> a.)

Def. 14: A formula cj> is said to be an argumentative
consequence of I.. denoted by L 1---- J4, (cj> a.), iff:
(i) there exists an argument for (cj> a.) in L , and
(ii) for each argument of (---,cj> J3) in I.. we have a.>f3.
We now sketch the procedure which determines if cj> is an
argumentative consequence of a stratified knowledge base
I.=B 1u...uB n. The procedure presupposes the existence
of an algorithm which checks if there exists an argument
for a given formula in some flat base. This can be achieved
by using the variant of a refutation method proposed for
example in [15].

The procedure is based on a construction of the maximal
argument of cj> and its contradiction. First we start with
the sub-base B 1. and we check if there is a consistent sub­
base of B1 which entails cj> or --.cj>. If the response is
respectively Yes-No then cj> is an argumentative
consequence of L with a weight a.1 = 1, by symmetry if
the response is No-Yes then ---,cj> is in this case the
argumentative consequence of I.. Now if the response is
Yes-Yes then neither cj> nor ---,cj> are argumentative
consequences. If the response corresponds to one of the
answers given above then the algorithm stops. If the
response is No-No we repeat the same cycle described
above with B 1 uBz. The algorithm stops when we have
used all the knowledge base I..
As discussed in the case of a flat knowledge base, the
inference relation 1---- � is non-monotonic, and if our
knowledge base is consistent then the set of formulas

J4, (cj> a.).

Proposition 11: Each 1t+Free-consequence of I. is also
an argumentative consequence of I.. The converse is false
The argumentative consequence is not comparable to the
Pref-consequence nor the Lex-consequence, as we see in
the following example:
Example
Let L = {{A,--.Bv--.A,B, C}. {---,Cv--.A}. {---, AvD}}
We have:
- Pref(I.) ={{{A,--.Bv---,A, C}. {---,A vD}}. {{A,B, C},
{--.AvD}}. {{--.Bv--.A,B,C}. {---,Cv-.A}. {--.AvD}})
- Lex(I.) = {{{--.Bv--.A,B,C},{---,C v---,A},{--.AvD}}}.
Then -,A is a Lex-consequence of I. while it is not an
argumentative consequence, since A is also present in
I.. Note that one may object to the deletion of A from
Lex(I.), given its high priority. Hence the Lex­
consequence looks debatable. In contrast, D is an
argumentative consequence (it derives from {A,-,A v
D } while it is not a Pref-consequence nor a Lex­
consequence. Again the Pref-consequence forgets the
argument, because A and -.Av D do not belong to all
preferred subbases.
Let L = {{A}. {--.A}. {-,A v --. D, A v D}}. we have
Pref(I.)={{A}, {--.Av---,D , AvD) } . In this case ---,D is a
Pref-consequence, while it is not an argumentative
consequence of I.. Again, the argument for D is killed
by Pref(I.).

As we have done in the non-stratified case,we summarize
the relationships between the different consequence
relations:

5. Paraconsistent -Like Reasoning
Layered Knowledge Bases

in

In the preceding sections we have seen how in the case of
flat and prioritized knowledge bases it is possible to use
consistent subparts of it in order to define different types
of consequences which are still meaningful. Levels of
priority or of certainty attached to formulas have also
been used to distinguish between strong and less strong
arguments in favor of a proposition or of its contrary.
However it is possible to go one step further in the use of
the certainty or priority levels by i) attaching to a
proposition cjl not only the (greatest) weight a attached to
a logical proof of <jl (in the sense of section 4) from a
consistent subbase, but also the weight � attached to the
strongest argument in favor of -,cp if any, and ii) by
continuing to infer from premises such (cjl, a , � )
propagating the weights a and � . It will enable us to
distinguish between consequences obtained only from
"free" propositions in the knowledge base I. for which
�=0 (i.e. propositions for which there is no argument in
I. in favor of their negation), and consequences obtained
using also propositions which are not free (for which
there exist both a weighted argument in their favor and a
weighted argument in favor of their negation).
More formally, the idea is first to attach to any
proposition in the considered stratified knowledge base I.
two numbers reflecting the extent to which we have some
certainty that the proposition is true and to what extent we
have sopte certainty that the proposition is false, and then
to provide some extended resolution rule enabling us to
infer from such propositions. For each cjl, such that (cj>a) is
in I., we compute the largest weight a' associated with
an argument for <jl and the largest weight W associated
with an argument for -,cp in the sense of Section 4. If
there exists no argument in favor of -,cp, we will take

417

P'=O; it means in this case that (cjl a) is among the free
elements of I. since cjl is not involved in the
inconsistency of I. (otherwise there would exist an
argument in favor of --.cjl).
In the general case, we shall say that c1> has a level of
"paraconsistency" equal to min(a',W). Classically and
roughly speaking, the idea of paraconsistency, first
introduced in [6], is to say that we have a paraconsistent
knowledge about c1> if we both want to state cjl and to state
-,cj>. It corresponds to the situation where we have
conflicting information about cj>. In a paraconsistent logic
we do no want to have every formula 'I' deducible as soon
as the knowledge base contains cjl and -,cj> (as it is the case
in classical logic). The idea of paraconsistency is "local"
by constrast with the usual view of inconsistency which
considers the knowledge base in a global way. It is why
we speak here of paraconsistent information when
min(a',P') > 0. Note that in this process we may improve
the lower bound a into a larger one a' if 3 Li �I., Li
consistent and Li1-7t(cj>a') (similarly for W if (-,cj> �) is
already present in I.). Then I. is changed into a new
knowledge base I.' where each formula (cj> a ) of I. is
replaced by (cjl a' W). Moreover if a'< W. i.e. the
certainty in favor of --.cj>is greater than the one in favor of
cj>, we replace (cjl a' W ) by (--.cj> W a'). If c1> is under a
clausal form, -.</)is a conjunction q>IA ... Aq>n ; in this
case we will replace (--.cj>P' a') by the clauses (q>i P' a'),
i=l,n in order to keep I.' under a clausal form if I. was
under a clausal form. Let us consider an example
.I.={(-,AvB a), (A�) (--.B0) (Bo), (-,BvC e), (-,C p)}.
Then:
I.' = {(-,Av B max(a,o) min(�,0)), (A� min(a,0 )),
(-,B max(0, min(p,e)), max(o, min(a.�))),
(Bmax(o, min(a.�)), max(0 , min(p,e))),
(-,B v c e min(p,o)), (-,C p min(e,o)) }.
Depending on the ordering between the weights we will
keep either (-,B x y) or (By x) depending if x > y or y >
x. If x = y we will keep both of them in I.'.
In a second step an extended resolution rule can be
proposed in order to infer from propositions in I.'. This
rule expressed in clausal form is (see the full report for a
proof, see [8] also):
(A v B a' pt)
(--.B v c o' o')
(A v C e' p')
e' = min(max(0',P'). max(a',B'))
p' = max(W,o').
When W=o'=O , i.e. the premises are not paraconsistent,
we obtain e'=min(a',0 '), p'=O. Clearly we have e'�p·, i.e.
the inference preserves the inequality between the
weights. We also observe that the degree of
paraconsistency o f the conclusion namely
min(e',p')=max(W,B') is equal to the maximum of the
degrees of paraconsistency of the two premises namely
with

418

Benferhat, Dubois, and Prade

min(a ',W)=W and min(� ,' o')=o'. Thus the inference rule
extends the standard possibilistic resolution [7, 10] and in
case of paraconsistent premise(s), propagates this
paraconsistency to the conclusion. In the case where one
of the premises is not paraconsistent, i.e. �' = 0 for
instance, the degree of certainty e' = min(0 ', max(a',o'))
of the conclusion is greater than its degree of
paraconsistency p' o' only if the degree of certainty a'
of the non-paraconsistent premise is greater than o' and
�·>o' (i.e. � ':t:o'). Otherwise the conclusion which is
obtained is SUCh that E' = p' = 0', i.e. nothing emerges
from inconsistency.

we have to choose between a highly certain but highly
paraconsistent conclusion and a conclusion with low
certainty and low paraconsistency. Lastly observe that for
the formulae appearing explicitly in .L, the paraconsistent
approach gives the same results as t- c54, They differ for
other conclusions since the paraconsistent approach
propagates the effects of local inconsistency.

Let us consider an example
I.= {(A 1), (-,AvB 0.8), (-,B 0.6), (-.Ave 0.5), (-,0
0.3), (-,AvO 0.4), (-,AvE 0.7), (-,FvG 0.5), (F 1), (-,F
0.2), (--.Hvl 0.3), (I 0.4) }.
Observe that I. 1-1t (..L 0.6), i.e. the global level of
inconsistency of the base is 0.6. Then we have
I.' = {(A 1 0.6), (--.AvB 0,8 0,6), (-,Ave 0.5 0), (0
0.4 0.3), (-.AvO 0.4 0.3), (-,AvE 0.7 0), (-,FvG 0.5
0), (F 1 0.2), (-.Hvl 0.3 0), (I 0.4 0) }.
Applying the "paraconsistent" resolution rule yields
(e 0.6 0.6), (E 0.7 0.6), (G 0.5 0.2), (I 0.3 0).
This shows that
-non-paraconsistent premises such as (-,Ave 0.5 0) with
a rather low degree of certainty resolved with another
premise (here (A 1 0.6)) whose level of paraconsistency is
larger than this degree of certainty, lead to fully blurred
paraconsistent conclusions, here (e 0.6 0.6). By
contrast 1-Free+1t would enable to get (e 0.5), while the
refutation procedure used in 1-1t yields (e 0.6), reflecting
the global inconsistency of the base
-if the non-paraconsistent premise is sufficiently certain
with respect to the paraconsistency of the other premise,
e.g. (-.AvE 0.7 0), and (A 1 0.6), the conclusion, here
(E 0.7 0.6) is not completely blurred. This is true even
if this certainty is less than the global level of
inconsistency of the base (e.g. (G 0.5 0.2) obtained from
(-.FvG 0.5 0), (F 1 0.2))
-if the premises are not paraconsistent, (e.g. (-,H v I 0.3
0), (H 0.4 0)), we obtain a non-paraconsistent conclusion,
as with t-Free+1t• since we do not use refutation.
Generally speaking, if a clause Av B is more
paraconsistent than the clause -,BvC is certain, then AvC
will be completely blurred by paraconsistency. Indeed
from a logical point of view, being more certain that
-.AA-,B is true than w e are certain that -,BvC is true,
the entailment AvB, -,A/1.-,Bt-AvC applies with a greater
level of certainty than AvB, -,Bve 1- AvC.
We can observe that using the "paraconsistent" resolution
rule locally in a knowledge base I.', may yield the same
proposition with different weights, namely (<I> a' W), (<I>
a"�"). In this case, a more certain and less paraconsistent
conclusion should be preferred; this is less obvious when

6. Combining knowledge bases
In [1] several approaches are proposed to combine
knowledge bases, and one of them is very similar to what
[4] calls "preferred sub-theories". The idea is to assume a
total ordering between different bases Lt>L 2> ... >Ln.
such that Li is more reliable than Lj for j>i. A resulting
base is constructed from I. 1 by adding as many formulas
as possible fromi.2 (wrt consistency criterion), then as
many formulas as possible from L 3, and so on. The
principal problem is that the resulting base is not unique.
Two approaches are proposed in [5] to merge bases
according to suspicious attitude or to trusting attitude.
The suspicious attitude is very conservative since for
example the result of merging two knowledge bases
L l>L 2 is equal to the union of the two bases if they are
not conflictual, and is equal to I. 1 in other cases. In the
trusting attitude, the approach is very similar to [1] and
produces always one resulting base, but unfortunately the
approach is very restrictive since the knowledges bases to
be merged must be sets of literals.
In the context of possibilistic logic, an approach has been
proposed in [11] for the fusion of n knowledge bases
L l, ... ,Ln· One way of defining the resulting base is to
consider the intersection of the deductively closed bases
en(I.i) •... , en(I.n) (by t-1t). It is clear that this approach
is very cautious. In the same paper, another approach has
been proposed considering now the union of the
deductively closed bases Cn(Li),...,Cn(I. n). However
when the resulting base is inconsistent, then some
formulas will be inhibited by the drowning effect [3]
We suggest a new approach to merge n knowledge bases
l: t. ..., l:n . For this aim we use of a variation of the
argumentative consequence relation, denoted by t- J4, Jvt,
Jvt, for the multi-sources, and which is defined in the
following way:
l:1 •..., l:n t-.,sfUI{,(<I> a) iff:
3I.i. such that Li 1- (<I> a), and

�I.j. such that I.j t- (-.q, �) such that � > a.
Then the resulting knowledge base is: I.result = {(<I> a) I
Ll•..., In t-3tJI{, (<I> a ) } . B e c a u s e Lresult c an b e
inconsistent, this approach should be used for question­
answering purposes only, and each response should be
accompanied with its argument.

Argumentative inference in uncertain and inconsistent knowledge bases

7.

Conclusion

The proposed notion of argumentative inference is
appealing for several reasons. First it is an extension of
classical inference (in the flat case) and possibilistic
inference (in the layered case) that copes with
inconsistency in a very "ecological" way. Namely it is
very faithful to the actual contents of the knowledge base,
and does not do away with information contained in it,as
opposed to the approaches based on preferred and
lexicographically preferred subbases. It avoids the
drowning effect of standard possibilistic logic by
salvaging sentences whose level of entrenchment is low
but are not involved in any contradiction set. Another
advantage is that it is amenable to efficient standard
implementation methods based on classical resolution.
Also it avoids outright contradictory responses (such that
<!> and -,cj>), although several deduced sentences can be
globally inconsistent. But as pointed out earlier, the
arguments supporting a set of more than two globally
contradictory sentences are distinct, so that the reality of
this contradiction is debatable, and only reflects the
presence of different points of view. Anyway it seems
that it is the price to pay in order to remain faithful to an
inconsistent knowledge base. Another result of the paper is
the use of local contradictions as a specific weight
attached to sentences. This approach only partially avoids
the drowning effect, but leads to more informative
responses than possibilistic logic since not only the
certainty of the formula is evaluated, but also its level of
conflict. In the future, the paraconsistent inference should
be positioned with respect to the other inference modes in
order to assess the benefits of carrying local weights of
conflict.
Lastly it would be interesting to apply the above result to
default reasoning and compare in such a framework the
argumentative inference and the one proposed by [24].
