Dynamic Construction Belief Networks describe method incrementally constructing belief networks developed network-construction language forward-chaining language using data dependencies additional features distributions Using language define parameterized classes probabilistic models parameterized models apply probabilistic reasoning impractical single static model Algorithm Finding MAP Assignments Belief Networks algorithm finding maximum a-posterior MAP assignments values belief networks belief network compiled network consisting nodes boolean i.e. conditional probabilities MAP assignment using best-first search network argue anticipate algorithm exponential linear size network poly trees Probabilistic Analysis Marker-Passing Techniques Plan-Recognition Useless paths chronic marker-passing techniques probabilistic analysis justify method identifying rejecting useless paths Using analysis identify key conditions assumptions marker-passing perform
