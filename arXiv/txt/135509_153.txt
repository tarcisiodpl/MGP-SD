Perception Attention Resources Decision-Theoretic Approach Graphics Rendering describe control graphics rendering limited computational resources taking decision-theoretic perspective perceptual costs computational savings approximations extends earlier control rendering introducing methods models computing expected cost associated degradations scene components expected cost computed considering perceptual cost degradations probability distribution attentional focus viewers review critical literature describing findings visual search attention discuss implications findings introduce models expected perceptual cost Finally discuss policies harness expected cost scene components
