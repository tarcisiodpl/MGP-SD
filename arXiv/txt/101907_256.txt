Welldefined Decision Scenarios Influence diagrams serve powerful tool modelling symmetric decision solving influence diagram determine set strategies decisions involved strategy decision variable principle function irrelevant decision computational reasons deal redundant variables strategies current methods e.g. Decision Bayes-ball algorithm Shachter UAI98 determine relevant complete algorithm paper takes outset formulating decision scenario influence diagram linear temporal decisions variables required constraint ensures decision scenario welldefined structure decision scenario yields decisions conditionally independent unnecessary impose linear temporal decisions paper deal partial influence diagrams i.e. influence diagrams partial temporal set conditions sufficient ensure partial influence diagram welldefined conditions basis construction algorithm determining partial influence diagram welldefined Representing Solving Asymmetric Bayesian Decision paper deals representation solution asymmetric Bayesian decision formal framework termed asymmetric influence diagrams based influence diagram allows efficient representation asymmetric decision opposed existing frameworks asymmetric influece diagram encodes asymmetry qualitative level read directly model algorithm solving asymmetric influence diagrams algorithm initially decomposes asymmetric decision structure symmetric subproblems organized tree solution decision propagating leaves root using existing evaluation methods solve sub-problems Using ROBDDs Inference Bayesian Networks Troubleshooting Example using Bayesian networks modelling behavior man-made machinery usually model deterministic Bayesian networks deterministic model represented Boolean function central belief updating reduces task calculating satisfying configurations Boolean function paper explore advances calculation Boolean functions adopted belief updating context troubleshooting experimental indicating substantial speed-up compared traditional junction tree propagation
