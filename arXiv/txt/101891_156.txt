Gaussian Process Networks paper address learning structure Bayesian network domains continuous variables task requires procedure comparing candidate structures Bayesian framework evaluating em marginal likelihood data candidate structure term computed closed-form standard parametric families e.g. Gaussians approximated computational cost semi-parametric families e.g. mixtures Gaussians family continuous variable probabilistic networks based em Gaussian Process priors priors semi-parametric nature learn arbitrary noisy functional relations Using priors directly compute marginal likelihoods structure learning method discover wide range functional dependencies multivariate data develop Bayesian score Gaussian Process Networks describe learn data empirical artificial data real-life domains non-linear dependencies
