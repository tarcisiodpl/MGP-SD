Symbolic Dynamic Programming Discrete Continuous MDPs real-world decision-theoretic planning naturally modeled discrete continuous Markov decision processes DC-MDPs previous addressed automated decision-theoretic planning DCMDPs optimal solutions defined limited settings e.g. DC-MDPs hyper-rectangular piecewise linear value functions extend symbolic dynamic programming SDP techniques provide optimal solutions vastly expanded class DCMDPs address inherent combinatorial aspects SDP introduce XADD continuous variable extension algebraic decision diagram ADD maintains compact representations exact value function Empirically demonstrate implementation SDP XADDs various DC-MDPs optimal automated solutions DCMDPs linear nonlinear piecewise partitioned value functions advantages constraint-based pruning XADDs
