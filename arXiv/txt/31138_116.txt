Complexity Decision Possibilistic Decision Trees uncertainty quantified simple probabilistic topic possibilistic decision theory natural consider development possibilistic decision theory lead series possibilistic criteria e.g pessimistic possibilistic qualitative utility possibilistic dominance binary possibilistic utility possibilistic Choquet integrals paper focuses sequential decision possibilistic decision trees proposes complexity study finding optimal strategy depending monotonicity property optimization criteria allows application dynamic programming offers polytime reduction decision possibilistic Choquet integrals satisfy property optimization NP hard Compiling Possibilistic Networks Alternative Approaches Possibilistic Inference Qualitative possibilistic networks min-based possibilistic networks tools handling uncertain possibility theory frame junction tree adaptation proposed exact reasoning networks paper explores alternative algorithms using compilation techniques propose possibilistic adaptations standard compilation-based probabilistic methods develop purely possibilistic method based transformation initial network possibilistic base comparative study performs possibilistic adap tations probabilistic methods result confirmed experimental
