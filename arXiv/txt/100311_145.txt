Planning Prioritized Sweeping Backups Efficient planning plays crucial role model-based reinforcement learning Traditionally main planning operation backup based current estimates successor Consequently computation time proportional successor paper introduce planning backup current value single successor computation time independent successor backup call backup door class model-based reinforcement learning methods exhibit finer control planning process traditional methods empirically demonstrate increased flexibility allows efficient planning implementation prioritized sweeping based backups achieves substantial performance improvement classical implementations
