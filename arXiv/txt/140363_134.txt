Belief Updating Enumerating High-Probability Independence-Based Assignments Independence-based IB assignments Bayesian belief networks originally proposed abductive explanations IB assignments assign fewer variables abductive explanations schemes assigning values evidentially supported variables IB assignments approximate marginal probabilities Bayesian belief networks belief updating Bayes networks attempts approximate posterior probabilities finding probability complete evidentially supported assignments assumptions probability mass union assignments sufficient approximation methods useful highly-connected networks maximum clique size cutset size standard algorithms intractable IB assignments fewer assigned variables probability mass assignment respective complete assignment fewer IB assignments sufficient approximation efficiently IB assignments efficiently approximating posterior node probabilities obey strict skewness assumptions previous algorithms finding probability IB assignments suggested best-first heuristic search special-purpose integer linear programming Experimental approach feasible highly connected belief networks
