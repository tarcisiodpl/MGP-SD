Regret-based Reward Elicitation Markov Decision Processes specification aMarkov decision process MDP difficult Reward function specification problematic practice cognitively complex time-consuming users precisely rewards casts rewards preference elicitation aims minimize degree precision reward function allowing optimal near-optimal policies produced discuss robust policies computed MDPs partial reward using minimax regret criterion demonstrate regret reduced efficiently eliciting reward using bound queries using regret-reduction choosing suitable queries Empirical demonstrate regret-based reward elicitation offers effective produce near-optimal policies resorting precise specification entire reward function
