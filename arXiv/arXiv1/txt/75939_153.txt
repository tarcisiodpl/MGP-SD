Survey Propagation Revisited Survey propagation SP exciting technique remarkably successful solving hard combinatorial determining satisfiability Boolean formulas promising attempt understanding success SP SP viewed form belief propagation computing marginal probabilities objects called covers formula explanation shortly dismissed experiments suggesting non-trivial covers simply exist formulas paper experiments misleading covers exist hard random formulas SP surprisingly accurate computing marginals covers existence cycles formulas re-opens simpler reasoning understanding SP contrast alternative lines explanation proposed assuming covers exist
