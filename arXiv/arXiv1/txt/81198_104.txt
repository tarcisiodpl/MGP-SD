Asynchronous Dynamic Bayesian Networks Systems sensor networks teams autonomous robots consist multiple autonomous entities interact distributed asynchronous manner entities track system evolves Asynchronous systems lead special challenges monitoring nodes update beliefs independently central coordination system continues change beliefs updated Previous approaches developing distributed asynchronous probabilistic reasoning systems static models approach using dynamic models account system changes time approach based belief propagation distributed asynchronous allows world changing messages Experimental approach compares favorably factored frontier algorithm
