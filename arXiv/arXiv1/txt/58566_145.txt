Improved Variance Approximations Belief Net Responses Network Doubling Bayesian belief network models joint distribution directed acyclic graph representing dependencies variables network parameters characterizing conditional distributions parameters viewed random variables quantify uncertainty values Belief nets compute responses queries i.e. conditional probabilities query function parameters random variable Van Allen al. quantify uncertainty query delta method approximation variance develop accurate approximations query variance key idea extend query approximation doubled network involving independent replicates method assumes complete data applied discrete continuous hybrid networks provided discrete variables discrete parents analyze improvements provide empirical studies demonstrate effectiveness
