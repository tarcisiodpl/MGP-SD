Efficient Test Selection Active Diagnosis Entropy Approximation consider diagnosing faults system represented Bayesian network diagnosis corresponds recovering unobserved nodes outcomes tests observed nodes Finding optimal subset tests setting intractable difficult compute most-informative test using greedy test selection involves entropy terms exact computation intractable propose approximate approach utilizes loopy belief propagation infrastructure simultaneously compute approximations marginal conditional entropies multiple subsets nodes apply method fault diagnosis computer networks algorithm effective realistic Internet-like topologies provide theoretical justification greedy test selection approach performance guarantees
