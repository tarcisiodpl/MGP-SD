We describe work to control graphics ren­
dering under limited computational resources
by taking a decision-theoretic perspective on
perceptual costs and computational savings
of approximations. The work extends earlier
work on the control of rendering by introduc­
ing methods and models for computing the
expected cost associated with degradations of
scene components. The expected cost is com­
puted by considering the perceptual cost of
degradations and a probability distribution
over the attentional focus of viewers. We re­
view the critical literature describing findings
on visual search and attention, discuss the
implications of the findings, and introduce
models of expected perceptual cost. Finally,
we discuss policies that harness information
about the expected cost of scene components.

Introduction

The rendering of h igh- quality 3D graphics is compu­
tationally intensive. We describe the use of decision­
theoretic models and methods to control rendering
approximations under limited or varying computa­
tional resources. After discussing several dimensions
of degradation associated with rendering approxima­
tion strategies, we review key results on visual search
and attention elucidated by cognitive psychologists.
The results provide context and guidance for building
models of visual attention and of the expected cost
of gr aph ics approximations. Following a discussion of
the implications of the psychological results, we sum­
marize our ongoing perceptual studies of image qual­
ity , and present a set of models that show promise for
guiding the control of rendering approximation. Fi­
n ally, we discuss how the models can be used to gen­
erate policies for rendering scenes. We describe appli­
cation of the methods within the Talisman graphics
architecture. The Talisman project at Microsoft [32]

has focused on the definition of a flexible multime­
dia architecture with the ability to deliver high-quality
graphics, audio, and video on personal computers.
In an earlier paper, we surveyed key problems and op­
portunities with the decision-theoretic control of mul­
tiple dimensions of rendering in systems b ased on a lay­
ered graphics pipeline [13]. In this paper, we present
additional details on building and using perceptual
models for regulating rendering under scarce resources.
Our overall concerns and goals with tradeoffs in graph­
ics are related to the work of Funkhouser and Sequin
[9], who have explored adaptive strategies for selec­
tively controlling the level of detail of objects in the
interactive visualization of architectural models. In
distinction to prior work, we decompose the task of
modeling the expected cost of scenes into (1) the con­
struction of models of perceptual loss for image com­
ponents, (2) the development of probabilistic models
of attention that transform costs to expected costs,
and the (3) assembly of costs associated with different
components into a cost for an entire image or segment
of images. We describe how measures of the expected
cost of image components can be used in regulation
systems that seek to minimize the expected percep­
tual loss of images given limited or varying resource
constraints.

Dimensions of Rendering
Approximation

There has been growing interest in the development of
approximation strategies and architectures for render­
ing complex scenes. In several recent approaches, im­
ages are decomposed into sets of scene elements which
are manipulated separately. We can decompose an
image in a variety of ways, and can employ different
approximation strategies to degrade the fidelity with
which the individual components of scenes are ren­
dered. In the Talisman test bed, images are decom­
posed into a set of sprites which can be s ubjected to
individual approximations. Sprites are shaped image
layers with an associated two-dimensional transforma-

tion. Each pixel in the sprite image has, in addition to
the color chann els an alpha channel which allows for
non-rectangular image shapes and smoothly blended
boundaries. Sprites are selected based on the stability
in the structure and common trajectories of objects in
an image. We shall use sprites broadly in our discus­
sion to refer to a set of elements comprisin g an image
and the underlying geometric models, textures, mate­
rials, etc., needed to render each element's image.
,

Let us explore several graphics approximations strate­
gies . We will focus in particular on flexible strategies,

methods which can provide for the smooth degradation
in the fidelity of sprites, along one or more dimensions

of degradation, in return for diminishing computa­
tional requirements. Flexible rendering strategies in­
clude approximations that allow for the graceful re­
duction of model complexity, spatial resolution, shad­
ing complexity, and for the rate at which sprites are
updated. Typically, we can generate, for each of the
degradation dimensions, a corresponding measure of
error, or fiducial, which estimates the distance from a
gold-standard rendering along that dimension of qual­
ity.
The dynamic selection of simpler models from a spec­
trum of models to enhance rendering performance (re­
ferred to as detail elision) has been employed in a num­
ber of graphics systems. Model-simplification methods
include the storage of multiple models, the dynamic
simplification of the mesh of polygons that specify a.
model, and the choice of sampli n g for surfaces speci­
fied by parametric models. As the geometry used to
describe a model is simplified, details of its structure
are lost and artifacts appear in the form of errors in
the overall shape or surface characteristics of objects.
An example of a flexible model-simplification strategy
is the pmgressive mesh developed by Hoppe [12]. With
this approach, edges of p olygons composing a mesh are

progressive mesh method. The graph displays the rela­
tionship between a measure of model accuracy based

procedure.
selected for collapse into single vertices so as to min­
imize a measure of energy defined in terms of multi­
ple factors including the total number of vertices and
the squared distance of points in the simplified mod­
els from an ideal mesh. T he edge-collapse operation
is reversible with tractable vertex-splitting operations,
allowing for rapid t raversal of a sp ectrum of meshes.
Figure 1 displays a fully de tailed model and a point on
the spectrum of increasingly simplified models devel­
oped by the progressive mesh method. Figure 2 shows
the relationship between the number of polygons in­
cluded in a model and a measure of model accuracy
based on a summary energy measure.
Spatial resolution methods center on the control of the
number of samples dedicated to a sprite and by the im­
age compression factor. We can selectively reduce the
number of pixels devoted to a sprite. As the resolu­
tion is diminished, objects lose detail and ultimately
become granular and fuzzy. In Talisman, the sprite
transformation allows the sprite to be rendered with
a low number of pixels and interpolated to the higher
screen resolution. The quality of the resulting blur
depends on the quality of the image filtering.
The shading complexity is determined by the type of
texture filtering, texture level-of-detail, the -number of
lights used to illuminate a scene, and the use of shad­
ing effects such as reflections or shadows. Diminish­
ing shading complexity introduces granularity and ar­
tifacts in the subtleties of lighting and reflection. For
example, a reduction in the texture level-of-detail blurs
the texture applied to the object. The magnitude of
error can be captured by photometric estimates.
Temporal resolution methods center on the control of
the rate at which scenes or components of scenes are
updated. Temporal resolution methods include the
simple approach· of reducing the frame rate to allow

enough computation to render scenes. This common
approach leads to problems with flicker and is espe­
cially costly in interactive applications. A more so­
phisticated temporal-resolution strategy i s to maintain
frame refresh rate, but to render objects within frames
at different frequencies depending on the configuration
and dynamics of objects.
The manipulation of temporal resolution of individ­
ual sprites is central in Talisman. In Talisman, com­
putationally inexpensive transformations are applied
to update sprites generated from previous frames so
as to approximate the general motion of an object or
change of viewpoint in three dimensions-instead of
undertaking more expensive re-rendering of the sprites
from 3D models. Talisman attempts to minimize the
computational requirements of rendering by employ­
ing inexpensive 2D transformations on previously ren­
dered sprites rather than re-rendering sprites where
possible. Where possible, computationally inexpen­
sive 2D affine transformations are employed to update
sprites generated for previous frames so as to approx­
imate the general motion of an object or change of
viewpoint in three dimensions-instead of undertak­
ing more expensive re-rendering of the sprites from
3D models. Thus, Talisman attempts to adapt previ­
ously rendered sprites , bypassing the more expensive
task of re-rendering the sprites, but potentially induc­
ing spatial and temporal artifacts. Several groups have
explored the similar use of inexpensive warping trans­
formations on subcomponents of images to reduce real­
time computation [25, 27, 3, 20].
In Talisman, sprites rendered in an earlier frame will
continue to be transformed and reused in new frames
until an estimate of error exceeds a tolerated error
level. A small number of positions in the image , called
characteristic points, are used to monitor and estimate
the error as a function of the distances between the
reused sprite and the actual sprite in the new frame.
As the level of tolerated error is increased , the number

tional savings. The schematized graphs highlight

tween measures of simplification, and perceptual and

of sprites that need to be re-rendered in each frame
typically drops. However, as the error threshold is
increased , geometric and temporal artifacts become
more salient as sprites that have been warped for sev­
eral frames are replaced with are-rendered sprite after
the larger error thresholds have been exceeded. By in­
creasing the tolerated error, we save on resources by
minimizing re-rendering, but may introduce noticeable
artifacts in object distortion, problems with visibility
of overlapping sprites, and discontinuities.
Figure 3 highlights the savings that can be achieved
with sprite reuse. The left panel of the figure displays
a frame drawn from a sequence of frames produced
by a Talisman simulation that depicts two spacecraft
traveling over mountainous terrain. The right panel
shows a set of boxes that bound the individual sprites
in the scene. The sprites that have been re-rendered
for this frame are highlighted with solid lines, while the
larger number of sprites that have been reused through
inexpensive transformations are bounded with rectan­
gles composed of broken lines.

Perception and Computation

Optimization of graphics rendering under varying re­
source constraints poses challenges at the interface be­
tween computation and cognition. We seek to model
how degradations along different dimensions of render­
ing approximation can influence the perception of the
quality of a scene. In addition, we wish to understand
how a user's attention to different components of an
image can change impressions of quality.
We may have access to information of the form por­
trayed in Figure 2, detailing the relationships between
simple summaries of errors and alternate simplifica­
tions generated by flexible strategies. However, to
understand the actual perceptual costs and benefits,
we need to make the additional link to computational
resources and perceptual accuracy, and to extend our

Decision-Theoretic Approach to Rendering

unders ta n ding to multipl e combinations of degrada­
tion. This goal is captured by Figure 4, which high­
lights the missing li nk s between measures of accu­
racy and estimates of computational load, and between
measures of accuracy and the p ercei ved quali ty of im­
ages.

The overall aim of capturing the influence of multiple
factors on the perceptual quality of images is the de­
velopment of a rich, multiattribute perceptual utility
model that represents the perceptual cost associated
with the degradation of i mages from a gold-standard
image or set of images . Attempts to map dimensions
of image deg radati on to perception of quality brings us
into the realm of the psychology of visual perception.

Findings in Visual Perception

The cognitive psychology of vision is an active area of
research fraught with c omp eting and comp le ment ar y
theories ' numerous studies, and an array of interesting
results. Several areas of investigation in visual p er­
cepti on have relevance to our pursuit of links between
perceptual quality of images and rendering decisions.
As highlighted by the schematized functions displayed
in Figure 5, we wish to move beyond information dis­
played in F ig u re 2 to map the links between p�r­
ceptual quality and the metrics us_ed to ch�racte_nze
the degradation of graphics along different dimensiOns
(e.g., total squared distance deviation of mesh, tol­
erance of warp error-estimate, diminished resolution).
We also need to characterize how various combinations
of degradations, can i nfluen ce subjective impressions
of the quality of a scene-and to understand how at­
tention to different aspects of a scene influences the
cost of degradations. After all, our goal is to provide
content that is visually satisfying to people. Simple
scientific goals focused on maximizing precision across
the board are likely to be naive from the p oi nt of view
of genuinel y optimizing the final visual result.
4.1

Visual Search and Attention

The paradi gm in psychology for measuring the abil­
human subjects to identify various features in
scenes centers on a visual-search methodology. Studies

i ty of

of visual search have attempted to measure the abil­

ities of human subjects to no tice various components
of scen es . A large set of studies have uncovered two
interrelated classes of visual processing, referred to as
preattentive and attentive vision, respectively. Preat­
tentive vision is thought to continually scan large areas
at a time in parallel, efficiently n oti ng features repre­
sen t i n g basic ch anges in pattern or motion . Atten­
tive visual processes refer to the more serial, resource­
limited processes found to be re q uired to recogniz e de­
tai ls about objects and relatio nships in scenes.

241

Neisser noted that features efficiently detec ted by the
preatt ent ive visual processes include the overall color,
size, lumin ance , motion, temporal onset of patterns,
and simple aspects of shape like orientation, curva­
ture (but not closure, gaps or terminators) [21]. Julesz
defined a class of features efficiently discriminated by
preattentive vi sion, referred to as textons [17]. Tex­
tons include elongated shapes such as ellipses, rect­
angles, and line segments that have specific colors,
widths, l engths , orientations, depths, v elocities , and
flicker. Textons also include the ends of line segments,
referred to as terminator s, and the crossing of lines.
Preattenti ve processing has been shown to be limited
in its abi lity to detect the absence of features in a tar­
get amidst a sea of similar targets that contain the fea­
ture (e.g., fi nding a ci rcle without a slash among circles
with a slash). More generally, the parallel, preatten­
tive processes cannot efficiently identify cases where
distinct features are conjoined into higher-level pat­
terns or objects; identifying conjunctions of features
requires the m or e focused, resource-strapped attentive
vision processes.
Several studies have furt h er elucidated the links be­
tween preattent.ive and atten ti ve processes. For exam­
ple, researchers have foun d that objects may be recog­
nized rapidly through efficient i nteract ions of preatten­
tive and attentive processes and search can be made
more efficient through tr ain ing . An example of effi­
cient reco gn ition of objects is the "pop out" effect,
where objects seem to jump out of background pat­
terns. Wolfe, et al. p erfo rmed studies suggesting that
serial search for conjunctions can be guided and m ad e
more efficient taking advantage of parallel processes
[34]. The group proposed that pre attentive processes
can filter out distracters from candidates, and, thus,
reduce the size of the serial search. This effect appears
to depend on the quality of the gui d ance provided by
the parallel processes, and enhanced when elements
are distinguished by luminance and color contrast, or
w hen there are discontinuities in spatial or t emporal
patterning of the first-order properties giving rise to
motion or texture differences [2]. Treisman and Gelade
have studied the ability of people to r ecogniz e conjunc­
tions of features. The team proposed and found evi­
dence for the feature-integration theory of attention,
where features are detected early on but are only re­
lated to one another to form recog niz able objects with
focused at t en tion [33]. They also showed that recogn i­
tion tasks were diminished by distraction and diverti ng
of attention.

Investigation of visual attention has also explored the
realm between preattentive and attentive processes by
seeking out context-dependent changes in p ercep tual
abilities. Under some conditions, visual resources ap­
pear to be distributed evenly over a display, with ap­
parent parallel processing of display items [18, 29]. In
o ther situations, a focused, serial scann i ng of ite m s in

242

a display occurs [7, 24]. One study showed that it is
difficult for viewers to split their detailed visual atten­
tion to two separate spatial regions [23]. Eriksen and
Hoffman have found the tight focus to have a diam­
eter of approximately 1 degree of visual angle. More
generally, response time and accuracy in search tasks
have been found to be influenced by the spatial rela­
tionships between a target object, the position and
number of related objects, and the location on the
screen that subjects have been cued to focus on via
verbal commands or visual stimuli [4, 31]. Reaction
times in search tasks have been found to be fastest if
attention is focused on the location of the target (23],
and to increase as the visual angle between a current
focus and target increases, as well as with the dimin­
ishing distance between a target and distractor objects
[8, 11' 22, 30].
Capacity models for attention have been developed
that attempt to describe the spatial characteristics
of visual attention. Several different classes of model
have been proposed including those where attentional
resources are considered as being allocated simulta­
neously in different amounts to different locations in
the visual field [28], models where resources are tog­
gled between a distributed and a focused, "spotlight"
state [16], and a "zoom-lens" model where there is a
tradeoff between the breadth and degree of attention,
and where resources are distributed evenly within the
purview of the lens, from large views at low accuracies
or power, to tighter focuses that are used to serially
explore small areas with high-resolution [8, 7, 6, 15].
Several experiments have provided some evidence for
the spotlight model [16] and for the zoom-lens model
[8, 5, 1]. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty about
which models best describe visual attention, and to
the extent that preattentive and attentive processes
are distinct or can be explained by a larger model of
attention.
4.2

Implications of the Findings

We wish to harness knowledge about the human visual
system to model how viewers perceive degradations
produced by rendering approximation. The basic find­
ings in visual search provide intuitions that are useful
for constructing parameterized models of perceptual
loss. Such models can be refined by performing stud­
ies with subjects viewing a range of approximations
produced by a graphics system.
In particular, results about the difficulty of viewers
recognizing objects and missing details in objects in
time-pressured search have implications in models of
perceptual cost and of attention. The finding that ob­
ject recognition is largely a function of attentive pro­
cedures and that attentive vision is a serial, resource­
constrained process suggests that the perceptual cost
of selective degradations is likely to be sensitive to

the details of a viewer's attention, and that percep­
tual losses are minimized when the viewer is attending
to portions of an image that are not significantly de­
graded.
The findings also characterize spatial and temporal
features that guide a viewer's attentive processes to
recognize objects and patterns more efficiently. Such
results suggest that rendering artifacts may be espe­
cially prominent if they lead to discontinuities in such
attributes as color, texture, or motion may lead to
a "popping-out" of artifacts. The studies of attention
can provide us with insights for developing models that
relate the ease with which a viewer may notice objects
as a function of their spatial relationships with an ob­
ject at the center of attention.
To further extend our understanding of the links be­
tween the results from visual search research and the
perceptual quality of images rendered by different reg­
ulation policies, we have been collaborating with cog­
nitive psychologists on sets of perceptual studies aimed
at directly exploring the influence of various rendering
policies on the overall perception of image quality. We
are investigating the perception of loss of quality as
a function of dimensions of degradation provided in
the Talisman system, including diminishment of spa­
tial and temporal resolution individually and in com­
bination. [14]. We have also been performing studies
with gaze-tracking equipment to gain an understand­
ing of attention as a function of content and to char­
acterize perception of image quality as a function of
attention.

Modeling the Cost of Rendering
Approximation

The serial nature of attentive vision highlights oppor­
tunities for building models of degradation as a func­
tion of focus of attention, and for dynamically allocat­
ing resources based on attention. We shall now de­
scribe our work to build models for controlling graph­
ics rendering inspired by the results on human visual
perception and attention.
We decompose the modeling task for attention-based
rendering into the tasks of ( 1) building a model of
cost of perceptual degradation capturing the per­
ceived losses as sprites are displayed with diminishing
resources, (2) developing a model of attention, which
provides probabilities that objects in a scene will be
at the focus of a viewer's attention, and (3) providing
a model that combines the costs of degradation assoc­
iated with multiple sprites into the comprehensive cost
of an entire frame or sequence of frames. Such mod­
els provide a foundation for refinement with empirical
studies of cost and attention.
We shall consider first deterministic measures of per­
ceptual cost. Then, we will develop a measure of

and of the overall scene complexity on a viewer's per­

approximations. As highlighted by the set of schema­

tized curves in Figure 5, we seek to understand the in­
fluence of attention on the functions linking perceptual

quality to various approximations of rendering sprites
or larger objects. After describing models of attention,
we shall mesh the models of attention and models of
cost described above to generate a model of expected

not attending to specific elements of an image. We seek
to compute an expected cost of a rendered scene by ap­
proximating the probability, p(A5•IE), that a user is
selectively focusing on sprite S; given some evidence,
E. Evidence can include information about the struc­
ture of a scene, and, where relevant, about the goals
associated with an interactive task such as a computer
game.
In a continuous attentional model, we assume a scalar
measure of attention as a random variable that varies
between representing a minimal amount of attention
at zero and a maximal amount of attention at one.
With this model, the expected perceptual cost is,

We can simplify this model by factoring the attention
variable out of the cost function. In such a model, we
revert to the attention-independent form of cost func­
tion which represents the quality of a rendered sprite
when attention is fully focused on that sprite. We
diminish the cost by a multiplicative attention factor,
a(x), which ranges between zero and one, as a viewer's
attention varies between no attention and full atten­
tion to a sprite,

We can simplify Equation 3 to the binary attentional

attend to the object, and that the viewer perceives
the full cost of a degradation when attending and a
diminishment of the cost when not attending,

is a constant factor.

We can further simplify the binary model by assum­
ing that a is zero, implying that sprites that are not
receiving attention do not contribute to the cost of

5.3

Conditioning on Contiguous Objects

Although we can cast all of our equations for atten­
tion and expected cost in terms of individual sprites,
it can be useful to jump to a model of attention based
on the natural tendency for viewers to attend to con­
tiguous objects. That is, we consider the probability,

p(A5•i lA 0i, E), of attending to an image element con­

ditioned on the viewer selectively attending to a set of
interrelated elements that are perceived as contiguous
object, OJ. For example, if we substitute into the dis­
crete attention model (Equation 4) the probabilities of
attending to objects and the conditional probabilities
of attending to sprites given the focus on the specific
objects, the expected cost is

j
+[1- p(A5'1 IA01, E)p(A01 IE)]aCP(Rk, S;j)

(6)

where p(A O; IE) is the probability of a user attend­
ing to an object, and p(A5•.i IA0i, E) is the probabil­
ity that a user will attend to elements ij of object j,
given that the viewer's attention is drawn to that ob­
ject, and C(Rk, S;j) is the perceptual cost of applying
degradation strategy Rk to render element S;j. For
the simpler binary model, the expected cost is just,
£.CP

(7)
The models of expected cost of rendered scenes pro­
vide a framework for studying the perception of image
quality as a function attention and of multiple degra­
dations. They also provide an outline for constructing
and using models of cost and attention to control ren­
dering.
We can build upon these basic models to develop
the means for representing such potential attentional
mechanisms as the tradeoff between the radial breadth
of attention and the degree of attention (the zoom­
lens model), by introducing additional structure such
as parameters that describe the probability distribu­
tion over the degree of attention as a function of the
radial distance from objects at the center of attention.

Models of Attention

In the context of our models, the more we know about
the selective attention of viewers to particular aspects
of a scene, and the smaller that a is, the more we
can enhance the perceived quality of images under
computational resource constraints by selectively de­
grading sprites that have minimal expected cost. We
seek to characterize the time-dependent probability
distribution over a viewer's attention as a function of
distinctions in images being viewed, the task at hand,
and context. Probabilistic models of a viewer's at­
tention can range from coarse hand-authored approx­
imations based on heuristics about attention to more
complex models learned from data about the gaze of
viewers, conditioned on content and task.
Some computer applications provide a set of task­

abilistic models of attention. For example, the time­
varying goals and point systems that are defined in
computer games can be used to generate probabil­
ity distributions over the attention being directed at
graphical objects. In, gaze-tracking studies of user's
playing computer arcade games at the Microsoft us­
ability labs , we have found that game contexts are in­
duce proto typ ic al patterns of gaze in r elat i on to ren­
dered objects.

The probabilities that a viewer will attend to a spe­
cific sprite com p r ising an object , p(A5•; I A0i , E ) , can
be generated as a f unctio n of such factors as whether
the sprite defines an edge of an object, the portion of
the surface area of the total obj e c t occupied by spr i t es
and the degree to which the approximately rendered
sprite does not naturally fit into the object. The latter
can be captured as a function of the perceptual cost
described earl ier. That is, we condition the attention
p artly on the cost, p(A5'i I A0i , E, CP) . Here the per­
ceptual cost provides input to the probability that the
u ser will att end to the sprite-in addition to serving
as the cost component of the expected cost model .

by objects and the virtual distance from objects to the
viewers can serve as inputs to mod el s of attention .

Beyond automated approaches, we can rely on t h e ex­
pert judgments of the authors of graphics content . We
are working to provide a language and associated au­
thoring tools that allow authors to specify informa­
tion about the likely pattern of a viewer's attention
for scenes in rendered movies. The goal is to ease
the burden on authors by providing stereotypical mod­
els of attention that take as inputs an author 's high­
level descriptions about the viewer's attention. Rather
than require authors to provide inputs about the de­
tailed priorities of multiple sprites, we allow authors
to specify primary foci or to classify objects in scenes
as elements of one of several key groups of objects
such as primary ac tors, secondary actors, critical en­
vironment, and background environme nt. Such foci or
groups serve as arg u m e nt s to models of attention that
generate the likelihoods that other objects in a scene
will be noticed by a viewer given these foci and ad­
ditional evidence abo ut the scene . Evidence includes
features from the scene that capture significant spatial
and temporal relationships w i t h objects at the focus
of attention such as the class of object, size of obj ect,
and optical d ist anc e of the object from the viewer. We
can employ spotlight or zoom lens model and make the
size of the scope ·of attention a constant or a function
of properties of the objects in an image.
At run-time, the likelihoods that a user will attend
objects in each class of obj ect , p( G) is assigned
and the probabilities of the n objects in each of the
groups is assigned a probability modulated by key de­
tails about the configuration of the obj ects. Once
obj ects h ave been as s ign ed probabilities, conditional
probabilities of attending to the sprites comprising t he
objects are assigned. We t ake as inputs the key foci
of attention , A0" , and employ functions of features in
the sce ne to approximate the conditional p rob abi lit ies
p(A0· I A0' , E) . These conditional probabilities can be
substituted for p(A0• I E) in the expected cost models.

There is opp o r t u n ity for learning probability distribu­
tions over attention , conditioned on information about
a scene, including an author's input. Such models
would allow fo r Bayesian inference to diagnose atten­
tion. Inference in real-time would be restricted to
the solution of tractable inference models (e.g., naive
Bayesian diagnosis) . However, more com plex inferen­
tial models may be of value in the offline assignment
of attention for use in real-time rendering .

Consideration o f Cost over Multiple
Frames

Although we have focused on cost associated with ren­
dering sprites for single frames, it can be important to
consider t h e cost over a set of recent frames. Such
richer cost functions must consider the contributions
of the visual persistence of an artifact across frames.
Consideration of t h e expected cost over the last n
frames, CP (t - n) , requires modeling the cost and at­
tention as a function of the persistence and dynamics
over multiple frames. A viewer is more likely to no­
ti ce an artifact in an object that persists over t ime.
Thus , we m ust consider in parallel the influence of the
persistence of artifacts on the probabilities that a user
will attend to sprites, conditioned on the recent his­
tory of error, p(AS;; I A0i , E, CP(t - n) ) . P ro ce dur al ly
for each sprite , we must maintain a list of recent error
associated w it h that sprite in individual adj acent or
recent frames and combine this list into an overall cost
to evaluate the current probabilities and costs.

Let us focus on the control of regulation in the Tal­

The two key dimensions of ren­

dering approximation in the Talisman architecture are
temporal and spatial resolutio n .
Decisions can be
made about the spatial resolution of sprites and about
the error tolerated in the reuse of individual sprites
through inexpensive warping procedures before they
are re-rendered with costly procedures.

We seek to

render images of the highest quality by choosing to
render a set of sprites and applying inexpensive two­
dimensional transformations to the remaining sprites
such that the expected perceptual cost of a frame or
a set of frames is minimized subject to the constraint
that the total time is less than or equal to the time
available for generating the frame, given the target

we seek to maximize the expected value of items

within a "knapsack" sized by computational resources
allowed by the system 's frame rate.
Although the
k napsack problem is NP-Complete, we can use infor­
mation about the marginal costs and benefits of ren­
dering sprites in a useful approximation .
Rerendering each sprite reduces the overall percep­
tual cost by this incremental amount in return for
the marginal computation required for rendering the
sprite.

The ratio of the incremental gain in quality

and the computational cost, gives us a measure the

The benefits are the computational sav­

ings incurred by putting off the rendering and relying
instead on a two-dimensional transformation of an ear­
lier sprite. Warping can impose geometric and tempo­
ral artifacts that become more salient as sprites that
h ave been warped for several frames are replaced with
a re-rendered sprite. By increasing the tolerated error,
we save on resources by minimizing re-rendering, but
m ay introduce noticeable artifacts in object distortion ,
problems with visibility o f overlapping sprites, and dis­
continuities.
We have built regulation policies for Talisman that
consider in sequence policies for re-rendering versus
warping sprites followed by spatial degradation. The
methods center on a consideration of the marginal
costs and benefits of the degradations.

We order

sprites for re-rendering by <I> ( S; ) until reaching the
computational deadline and compare the perceptual
cost of this policy with the policy of rendering only
the sprite with the highest marginal value. Choosing
the policy of these two with the minimal perceptual
cost can be shown to be of value within a factor of two
of the minimal cost policy [ 1 0] .

For some additional

control cost, we can employ a knapsack approxima­
tion procedure involving limited search among subsets
of sprites to bring the perceptual cost even closer to
the optimal value [26] .

Greedy Optimization for Multiple
Dimensions of Approximation

Moving beyond decisions within the realm of temporal
resolutio n , we can consider other dimensions of degra­
dation by taking advantage of the knapsack approxi­
mation for a means of efficiently comparing policies.
Although general search through the space of changes
for other dimensions , such as spatial degradation of
sprites, is intractable , we can quickly compare poli­

then the geometric level-of-detail, then spatial sam­
pling, and finally shading complexity. For each class
of degradation, we consider the effects of making a
predefined amount of degradation in return for the
gain associated with the ability to re-render additional
sprites with resources made available by the degrada­
tion. We can prune the consideration of sprites by ex­
amining the best increase in overall image quality that
is possible with the rendering of one additional sprite­
the sprite that is the first pruned from the render­
ing list because of the deadline . If no myopic changes
at one dimension will reduce the expected cost of the
scene, we move onto the next dimension. After all di­
mensions of degradation are considered we execute the
policy.

FUture Work and Summary

We have described key issues with the regulation
of graphics approximation procedures based on an
expected-cost approach . We reviewed central findings
on visual search and attention from the Cognitive Psy­
chology literature and presented expected-cost mod­
els that can take advantage of information about the
perceptual costs associated with rendering approxima­
tions. We described our use of the models to generate
rendering regulation policies . The approach has been
validated with sample rendering sequences.

We have

found value in assessing and manipulating separately
the key components of attention and perceptual cost
to maximize the perceptual quality of images under
limited resources.
We are studying several approaches to the control of
