Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) have been proposed as platforms for many intriguing applications, ranging from spintronics to topological quantum information processing. Realizing this potential will
likely be facilitated by the discovery of new, easily manufactured materials in this class. With this goal in mind
we introduce a new framework for engineering a 2D TI by hybridizing graphene with impurity bands arising
from heavy adatoms possessing partially filled d-shells, in particular osmium and iridium. First principles calculations predict that the gaps generated by this means exceed 0.2 eV over a broad range of adatom coverage;
moreover, tuning of the Fermi level is not required to enter the TI state. The mechanism at work is expected to
be rather general and may open the door to designing new TI phases in many materials.
PACS numbers:

Topological insulators comprise a class of strongly spinorbit-coupled, non-magnetic materials that are electrically inert in the bulk yet possess protected metallic states at their
boundary [1â€“3]. These systems are promising sources for a
host of exotic phenomenaâ€”including Majorana fermions [4â€“
7], charge fractionalization [8], and novel magneto-electric
effects [9â€“12]â€”and may also find use for quantum computing [2] and spintronics devices [13]. In some respects twodimensional (2D) topological insulators are ideally suited for
such applications; for example, bulk carriers that often plague
their three-dimensional counterparts can be vacated simply by
gating. Experimental progress on 2D topological insulators
has steadily advanced recently due largely to pioneering work
on HgTe [14â€“17] (see also Ref. [18]). Nevertheless, to realize their full potential systems more amenable to experimental
investigations are highly desirable. In this regard the ability
to design new 2D topological insulators from conventional,
widely available materials would constitute a major step forward, and many proposals of this spirit now exist [19â€“26].
Following this strategy, here we introduce a new mechanism for engineering a topological insulator state in
grapheneâ€”arguably now the most broadly accessible 2D
electron system. Historically, graphene was the first material
predicted to realize a topological insulator in seminal work by
Kane and Mele [1], though unfortunately the gap is unobservably small due to carbonâ€™s exceedingly weak spin-orbit coupling [27â€“31]. Reference [23] revived graphene as a viable
topological insulator candidate by predicting that dilute concentrations of heavy In or Tl adatoms dramatically enhance
the gap to detectable values of order 0.01 eV. Essentially, these
adatoms mediate enhanced spin-orbit interactions of the type
present in the Kane-Mele model [1] for pure graphene.
Our approach here also relies on hybridizing graphene with
dilute heavy adatoms, though the underlying physics is entirely different and can not be understood in terms of an effective graphene-only model. Rather, we will show using density
functional theory that certain adatomsâ€”specifically Os, Ir,
Cu-Os dimers, and Cu-Ir dimersâ€”form spin-orbit-split impurity bands that hybridize with grapheneâ€™s Dirac states in such a
way that a highly robust topological insulator regime emerges.

In fact here it is more appropriate to view the adatoms as the
dominant low-energy degrees of freedom, with their coupling
effectively mediated by graphene; from this perspective this
mechanism represents the inverse of that invoked in Ref. [23].
Numerous practical advantages arise in this scheme. The
topological insulator gaps are extremely largeâ€”typically exceeding 0.2 eVâ€”and take on nearly the full atomic spin-orbit
splitting for the adatoms. Such values reflect more than an
order-of-magnitude enhancement compared to the gaps induced by In or Tl, and are competitive with the largest gap
predicted for any topological insulator. Somewhat counterintuitively, these gaps are remarkably insensitive to the adatom
concentration, taking on comparable values at least over coverages ranging from âˆ¼ 2% âˆ’ 6%. In the case of Os adatoms
and Cu-Ir dimers, the Fermi level also naturally resides within
the topological insulator band gap. This eliminates perhaps
the most serious challenge with In and Tl, both of which substantially electron-dope graphene even at quite low coverages.
These features suggest that the observation of a topological insulator state in graphene may be within reach.
We first elucidate the mechanism uncovered here using a
tight-binding model that exposes the physics in a very transparent manner. Consider 5d adatoms residing at positions
R located at â€˜hollowâ€™ (H) sites in graphene as in Fig. 1(a).
For simplicity we retain only the dxz and dyz adatom states
since these comprise the most important orbitals in our firstprinciples calculations. (Recall that dxz/yz orbitals arise from
Lz orbital angular momentum m = Â±1 states.) We then
model the composite system by a Hamiltonian H = Hg +
Ha + Hc [23]. The first term allows nearest-neighbor hopping for graphene:

Let us now specialize to a periodic adatom arrangement
characterized by the 4 Ã— 4 supercell shown in Fig. 1(a), with
one adatom per cell (this corresponds to 6.25% coverage).
Figure 1(b) illustrates the band structure with t = 2.7 eV,
 = âˆ’0.5 eV, and tc = Î›so = 0. In this limit the adatoms
produce a four-fold degenerate flat band, reflecting spin and

orbital degeneracy. For the following discussion the precise
location of these adatom states is unimportant, provided they
intersect the carbon bands within âˆ¼ 1 eV of the Dirac points.
Incorporating tunneling between the adatoms and graphene
causes the flat bands to disperse, as shown in Fig. 1(c) for
tc = 1.5 eV. Suppose now that the Fermi level resides at the
dashed line in Fig. 1(c). Although the spectrum here exhibits
a sizable energy gap near the K point, the system remains
metallic due to band touchings at the zone center. The gapless
excitations at zero momentum exhibit the following two crucial properties: (i) they arise from weakly perturbed adatom
orbitals since at the zone center the nearest carbon bands reside well over 1 eV away in energy, and (ii) they are protected by time-reversal, spatial rotation, and SU(2) spin symmetries that coexist when Î›so = 0. Breaking the last of these
symmetries by turning on spin-orbit coupling thus produces
a bulk gap given nearly by the atomic spin-orbit splitting for
the adatoms, despite their dilute coverage. This key point is
demonstrated in Fig. 1(d) for Î›so = 0.2 eV, which yields a
0.32 eV gap that constitutes 80% of a single adatomâ€™s spinorbit splitting.
The gap opening indeed drives the system into a topological
insulator phase. Since our Hamiltonian is inversion symmetric this can be readily verified by computing Fu and Kaneâ€™s
formula for the Z2 invariant in Ref. [32]. For additional evidence the solid curve in Fig. 2(a) plots the density of states
(DOS) near zero energy for the same periodic adatom coverage on a graphene strip with armchair edges along x and periodic boundary conditions along y. (Our strip consists of 128
zig-zag â€˜rowsâ€™ of carbon sites, with 80 sites per row.) Edge
states characteristic of the topological phase produce a finite
DOS inside of the bulk gap, and are clearly resolvable in the
system size simulated over an energy window of 0.31 eV. As
an example, an edge state with mid-gap energy E = 0.004
eV appears in Fig. 2(b), where circles indicate adatom locations while the shading represents the probability amplitude
extracted from the wavefunction.
Remarkably, the formation of a topological insulator by no
means requires the periodic arrangements considered so far.
In fact similar physics arises even for completely randomly
distributed H-site adatoms. The dashed curve in Fig. 2(b) illustrates the DOS for the random case, again at 6.25% coverage. Even in our finite system one can easily resolve edge
modes within a 0.21 eV energy range that is comparable to
the bulk gap for the periodic case; see, e.g., the mid-gap state
with energy E = 0.003 eV plotted in Fig. 2(c).
Next we demonstrate using density functional theory (DFT)
that the mechanism described above can be realized in
graphene with 5d adatoms, notably Os and Ir. All DFT calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab-initio simulation
package (VASP) [33, 34] at the level of the local density approximation (LDA) [35], including spin-orbit coupling unless
specified otherwise. Positions of all atoms were fully relaxed
using the conjugated gradient method for energy minimization
until the calculated force on each atom became smaller than
0.01 eV/AÌŠ. Most results were obtained using the supercell in

FIG. 2: (a) Density of states for periodic (solid curve) and random
(dashed curve) adatoms at 6.25% coverage on a graphene strip with
armchair edges along x and periodic boundary conditions along y.
Parameters are the same as for Fig. 1(c). The finite density of states
within the bulk gap reflects edge states, which remarkably survive
even for randomly distributed adatoms. Examples of edge states for
the periodic and random cases respectively appear in (b) and (c).

Fig. 1(a), with one adatom per cell. For additional details see
[43]. Below we report our results for Os and then turn to Ir.
Since the thermal stability of adsorption structures is relevant for both experiments and applications, candidate adatoms
should ideally exhibit large H-site binding energies [defined as
Eb = E(graphene) + E(adatom) âˆ’ E(adatom/graphene)]
and high diffusion energy barriers [defined as âˆ†E =
Eb (Transition state) âˆ’ Eb (Ground state)]. Osmium satisfies both criteria. The binding energy for Os at the H site
in graphene is 2.42 eVâ€”much larger than the â€˜topâ€™ (directly
above a C) and â€˜bridgeâ€™ (above the midpoint of a C-C bond)
configurations for which Eb is 1.70 and 1.59 eV, respectively.
Moreover, the calculated diffusion barrier for an Os adatom to
diffuse from an H site through the top site is found to equal
the difference between the binding energies at these positions,
0.72 eV. The barrier for diffusion through the bridge site is
similarly given by 0.83 eV. Therefore Os adatoms should be
stable over H sites even at room temperature. By contrast most
3d transition metals have Eb âˆ¼ 1 eV [36] and are much more
mobile [36, 37]; for example, the diffusion barrier is only 0.40
eV for Co on graphene [38].
Figure 3(a) displays the DFT band structure for periodic Hsite Os adatoms on graphene at 6.25% coverage using the 4Ã—4
supercell in Fig. 1(a). Each Os adatom forms a charge state
of +0.55e (based on the Bader charge division scheme [39]),
indicating that the Os-graphene bonds mix covalent and ionic
features. Clearly these bonds dramatically modify the characteristic Dirac bands at the K point of pure graphene similar to Fig. 1. Most importantly, Os induces a large band gap
âˆ†SO = 0.27 eV, right at the Fermi level given by the green
dashed line in Fig. 3(a). As in our tight-binding model the gap
here results solely from spin-orbit coupling. (Without spinorbit interactions a gapless spectrum arises; see the Supplemental Material.) More precisely, the partial density of states
(PDOS) for the Os 5d orbitals displayed in Fig. 3(b) indicates
that the gap arises from the hybridization between grapheneâ€™s

Ï€ states and the spin-orbit-split dxz and dyz adatom orbitals,
also as in our tight-binding model. The PDOS for the dz2 ,
dx2 âˆ’y2 , and dxy orbitals, by contrast, is concentrated at much
lower energies. Thus the gap-opening mechanism introduced
earlier indeed appears in the realistic Os/graphene system.
The Os-induced gap depends exceptionally weakly on coverage. To illustrate this important point we performed simulations of graphene with one Os adatom in 5 Ã— 5, 7 Ã— 7,
and 10 Ã— 10 supercells (corresponding to coverages of 4%,
2.04%, and 1%). Circles in Fig. 3(c) show the DFT-predicted
gaps, which remain close to 0.2 eV even at 1% coverage. This
striking feature is actually rather natural since the local atomic
spin-orbit splitting for the Os dxz and dyz orbitals essentially
sets âˆ†SO .
Strictly speaking, a true topological insulator phase does
not arise in the DFT simulations described above since Os
forms small spin and orbital magnetic moments of 0.45 ÂµB
and 0.05 ÂµB , respectively. This produces visible splittings
of the bands at the Î“ and M points corresponding to timereversal-invariant momenta; see Fig. 3(a). One should keep
in mind, however, that DFT can sometimes overestimate moment formation. Nonetheless, even if a moment Ms indeed
appears in an experiment, there are practical means by which
this can be quenched to zero to reveal a bona fide topological phase [44]. One effective approach is to apply an external electric field Îµ. Figure 4(a) illustrates that Ms of Os on
graphene depends sensitively on Îµ. In particular Îµ < 0 transfers additional charge from Os to graphene and kills the moment for Îµ . âˆ’0.3 V/AÌŠ. The electric fields required to restore
time-reversal symmetry only weakly affect the band structure.
See, for example, Fig. 4(b) corresponding to 6.25% Os coverage with Îµ = âˆ’0.5 V/AÌŠ, where a time-reversal-invariant
topological insulator appears with a gap âˆ†SO = 0.26 eV.

4
Co-doping provides another means to quench the Os magnetic moment. To preserve the main features of the band structure while attracting charge away from Os (as accomplished
by a negative Îµ), co-adsorbates should interact weakly with
graphene and exhibit larger electronegativity than Os. Following this guidance, we considered Cu, Ag, and Au in several configurations as described in the Supplemental Material.
Whereas Os repels Ag and Au adatoms, Cu prefers to climb
over Os to form a vertical Cu-Os dimer over the H site. The
binding energy Eb = E(graphene) + E(Cu) + E(Os) âˆ’
E(Cu âˆ’ Os/graphene) for these dimers is 5.96 eV, higher
by 2.50 eV compared to that of well-separated Cu and Os
adatoms. Additionally, Cu more strongly anchors Os to the
H site since the binding energy for the vertical dimers over
the top (bridge) site is weaker by 1.27 (1.42) eV. This is not
the only relevant criterion, however, since in practice isolated
Cu and Os adatoms must be able to dimerize without overcoming substantial energy barriers. We explored this issue by
computing the total energies along the diffusion path depicted
in Fig. 4(c), where a Cu adatom beginning at position D ends
up above an Os at position A [45]. Figure 4(d) illustrates the
change in energy âˆ†E relative to the dimer state for various
positions along this trajectory. The energy barrier for a Cu
adatom to diffuse from location D to B is only âˆ¼ 0.08 eV;
once at position B the Cu strongly attracts to the top of Os
and forms the vertical dimer [46]. This suggests that dimer
formation ought to proceed quite efficiently.
Because of the hybridization and charge transfer between
the Cu and Os atomsâ€”the Bader charges of Cu and Os are respectively âˆ’0.21e and +0.67eâ€”DFT predicts that graphene
with Cu-Os dimers is nonmagnetic. The spectrum for (CuOs)/graphene at 6.25% coverage again supports a large topological insulator gap âˆ†SO = 0.21 eV as evident in the band
structure of Fig. 4(e). Moreover, the triangles in Fig. 3(c)
show that this gap exhibits similarly weak coverage dependence as for Os/graphene. The drawback here, however, is
that the Fermi level [green line in Fig. 4(e)] now resides in
the valence band. Returning the Fermi level to the insulating regime should be possible with conventional gating techniques, provided one works at low coverage.
Alternatively, the hole introduced by each Cu-Os dimer can
be compensated by replacing Os with Ir, which has one additional electron. Our calculations show that vertical Cu-Ir
dimers also strongly bind to the H-site in graphene without
forming a magnetic moment. Hybridization between Cu-Ir
dimers and graphene produces nearly the same band structure
as for (Cu-Os)/graphene, but with the Fermi level lying in the
band gap. See the band structure for 6.25% Cu-Ir coverage in
Fig. 4(f), where the gap is âˆ†SO = 0.25 eV. Additional results
for Ir/grapheneâ€”which behaves similarly to Os/grapheneâ€”
can be found in the Supplemental Material.
In summary, we have introduced a mechanism by which
graphene covered with heavy adatoms realizes a topological
insulator protected by a giant gap comparable to atomic spinorbit energies, even at exceptionally dilute coverages. Using DFT we predicted that Os, Ir, Cu-Os dimers, and Cu-Ir

dimers all give rise to this mechanism and produce gaps exceeding 0.2 eV at coverages as low as 2%. Although our
DFT calculations of necessity invoked periodic adatom configurations, our tight-binding simulations indicate that readily observable bulk (mobility) gaps should survive also in the
random case relevant for experiments. These findings are expected to greatly facilitate the realization of a topological insulator phase in graphene-based systems. We suspect, however,
that the mechanism exposed here has much broader applications since (contrary to Ref. [23]) the physics has nothing to
do with the Kane-Mele model specific to graphene. Hybridizing trivial metals or insulators with heavy-element impurity
bands may therefore provide a generic method for designing
new topological phases, which would be interesting to investigate in future work.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

Os/graphene and (Cu-Os)/graphene the gaps indeed originate
solely from spin-orbit interactions.

Energies of different Cu-Os co-adsorption configurations

In the main text we remarked that Cu and Os co-adsorbates
energetically prefer to form vertical dimers over the H-site in
graphene. Here we summarize the evidence supporting this
conclusion. We used DFT, without spin-orbit coupling, to explore the energetics of the various configurations displayed in
Fig. 6 (Os, Cu, and C atoms are respectively represented by
dark cyan, coral, and gray spheres). Note that in all cases
we fix the Os to the H-site since the binding energy for that
position greatly exceeds that for the top or bridge sites. (Additionally, Cu-Os dimers bind much more weakly to the top
and bridge positions.) The vertical Cu-Os dimer in configuration I exhibits a very large binding energy Eb = 6.17 eV. In
contrast the binding energy for configurations III and IV are
substantially lower by 2.50 and 2.09 eV, respectively. Configuration II is unstable and transforms to configuration I after
relaxation, indicating a strong tendency toward vertical dimer
formation. As we saw earlier the vertical dimer in (a) is nonmagnetic (with or without spin-orbit coupling), whereas the
other configurations are magnetic.

Electronic properties without spin-orbit coupling

To confirm that the band gaps induced by Os and CuOs stem from spin-orbit coupling, we performed DFT calculations for these adatoms at 6.25% coverage in the nonrelativistic limit. For Os/graphene, we find that in the absence of spin-orbit coupling the Os spins polarize much more
strongly compared to the relativistic case yielding a magnetic
moment Ms = 1.52ÂµB . The spin splitting is clearly visible
in the partial density of states for the Os 5d orbitals shown in
Fig. 5(a), where positive and negative values on the horizontal axis correspond respectively to the majority and minority
spin channels. The band structure for the majority spins (solid
curves) and minority spins (dashed curves) appears in Fig.
5(b). Notice that in sharp contrast to the spin-orbit-coupled
case, both spin channels are always gapless for any value of
the chemical potential (at least over the energy range shown).
Interestingly, (Cu-Os)/graphene remains non-magnetic even
in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. From the band structure in Fig. 5(c) one clearly sees that here, too, the system
remains gapless in the non-relativistic limit. Thus for both

Results for Ir/graphene

Finally, we briefly highlight our results for Ir adatoms on
graphene. We found that Ir slightly prefers the H site over the
bridge site, the binding energy being 2.17 eV in the former
configuration and 2.12 eV in the latter. The binding energy
for Ir at the top site is weakest at 1.94 eV. All results discussed henceforth thus correspond to H-site Ir adatoms. Without spin-orbit coupling DFT predicts that Ir/graphene is nonmagnetic. Figures 7(a) and (b) illustrate the band structure
and partial density of states for the Ir 5d levels, calculated at
6.25% coverage. Just as for Os and Cu-Os dimers, here too
the system remains gapless in the non-relativistic limit.
Figure 7(d) shows that restoring spin-orbit coupling introduces a huge band gap âˆ†SO = 0.21 eV below the Fermi level
(green dashed line). Moreover, in Fig. 7(c) we see that this
gap results from hybridization between the Ir dxz/yz orbitals
and grapheneâ€™s Ï€ bands, similar to Os/graphene and the tightbinding model described in the main text. Spin-orbit interac-

FIG. 7: (a) Band structure and (b) PDOS for Ir 5d orbitals obtained
for Ir/graphene at 6.25% coverage, without SOC. The green horizontal dashed line denotes the Fermi level. Here the system is nonmagnetic, and the spectrum is again always gapless similar to Figs.
5(b) and (c). In (c) and (d) we display the PDOS and band structure
calculated with spin-orbit coupling. A large spin-orbit-induced gap
opens below the Fermi level, though the bands are split slightly due
to weak moments formed by Ir in this case. As discussed in the main
text replacing Ir with Cu-Ir dimers returns the Fermi level to within
the gap and quenches the moment to restore time-reversal symmetry.

tions also, however, produce small spin and orbital moments
for Ir given respectively by 0.30 ÂµB and 0.13 ÂµB ; these are responsible for the weak band splittings in Fig. 7(d). Coverage
dependence of the gap is illustrated in Fig. 8. As in all other
cases studied here, the gap remains quite large down to very
dilute Ir concentrations. Even at 1% coverage where âˆ†SO
reduces to 0.08 eV the gap exceeds that induced by In or Tl
adatoms [23] many times over.
Observing a true topological insulator phase in Ir/graphene
is complicated by the magnetic moments predicted by DFT
and the fact that the Fermi level resides in the conduction
band. (One should again keep in mind, however, that DFT
may overestimate the tendency for moment formation here.
Furthermore, it may be feasible to gate the system back to the
insulating regime by conventional means at low coverages.) In
the main text we described how co-doping with Cu eliminates
both potential challenges. Here we simply wish to note that
Cu-Ir dimers carry yet another advantageâ€”they strongly enhance binding to the H-site compared to isolated Ir adatoms,
similar to the Os case. Indeed, the binding energy for Cu-Ir
dimers over the H-site is larger by 0.62 eV and 0.79 eV compared to the bridge and top sites, respectively. By contrast the
differences for pure Ir are only 0.05 eV and 0.23 eV as we saw
above.

[43] We used the projector augmented wave (PAW) method for the
description of the core-valence interactions [40, 41]. A vacuum
space of 15 AÌŠ was adopted to separate the periodic graphene
slabs. The two-dimensional Brillouin zone was sampled by a
15 Ã— 15 k-grid mesh [42]. The energy cutoff of the plane wave
expansion was set to 500 eV.
[44] Actually for some applications such as the pursuit of Majorana fermions, time-reversal symmetry breaking can be a feature rather than a bug; see Refs. [5] and [7]
[45] Here we calculated the Cu diffusion energy barrier without
spin-orbit coupling. The energy is not expected to change significantly, however, with the inclusion of relativistic effects
since Cu exhibits relatively weak spin-orbit interactions. Note
also that since Cu is physisorbed on graphene, changes to the
trajectory will not appreciably alter the diffusion barrier.
[46] More precisely, when the Cu is located at position B, DFT predicts that it spontaneously climbs to the top of Os to form the
vertical dimer when we allow the atomic positions to relax. This
is why no intermediate points between A and B are shown in
Fig. 4(d).
