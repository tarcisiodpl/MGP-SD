There is currently no

In this paper,

we introduce the concept of semi-instrument,
which generalizes the concept of instrument:

each instrument is a semi-instrument, but the
converse does not hold.

We show that in

the framework of additive models, under cer­
tain conditions, we can test whether a vari­
able is semi-instrumental. Moreover, adding
some distribution assumptions, we can test
whether two semi-instruments are instrumen­

tal.

We give algorithms to test whether a.

variable is semi-instrumental, and whether
two semi-instruments are both instrumental.
These algorithms can be used to test the ex­
perts' choice of instruments, or to identify in­
struments automatically.

INTRODUCTION

One of the major advantages of knowing the causal
relations among the variables we are interested in is
that we can use the causal structure to predict the
effects of interventions. For example, if we know that a

1 Here by intervention we mean the manipulation of the
value of one random variable, with the assumption that
this manipulation can affect other variables only through
the manipulated variable. We also assume no feedback,
i.e., no directed cycles, and no reversible causal relations,
in a causal graph. See Spirtes et al (2001)

4Pearl (1995) shows that, for discrete data, Z being an
instrument for X and Y imposes some constraint, which is
called by him as instrumental inequality, on the joint dis­
tribution of Z, X, andY. This inequality is not sufficient
for Z to be an instrument, and, as pointed in this paper, it
cannot be extended to the continuous models. This paper
does not give an instrument testing procedure for discrete

Note that a linear model is a special case of the ad­
ditive model. Thus, given that we cannot determine
whether a random variable is an instrument in a linear
model, we could not, in general, determine whether it
is an instrument in an additive model. Therefore, we
should look for some other conditions, preferably a lit­
tle bit weaker than those required by an instrument, so
that a random variable that satisfies these conditions
can be identified in an additive model.
One such candidate set of conditions is what we call

is an instrument.

The above analysis suggests two possible approaches
for instrument testing. First, we may extend the space
of linear structural models to a larger space. The idea
is that the space of linear structural models already im­
p oses strong constraints on each variable so that being
an instrument does not impose any extra constraints.

However, i n a larger space, it is possible that being
an instrument does imply some conditions not neces­
sarily satisfied by all models in that space. Another
approach is to get more candidates for instrumental
variables, and see whether the instrument assumption
imposes some constraint on the joint distribution of
these candidate variables.
In this section we shall try a combination of both ap­

the semi-instrumental conditions. A random variable

To test whether a random variable

whether all the four conditions are satisfied.

How­

ever, it turns out that not all these four conditions are

For example, the second condition, i.e., Z

These two conditions are much stronger than what we
need. Actually, we only need to assume the boundary of
the support of the (X, t:x ) has no positive probability, (see
proof of Theorem 2.3 in Newey et a! (1999)), and that all
the functions are absolutely continuous. We choose these
two conditions because they are more intuitive.

TWO SEMI-INSTRUMENTS

If the test for whether a random variable, say, zl' is a
semi-instrument for

X andY

gives a negative result,

there is not much left to do with

Z1.

However, if the

test says that zl is a semi-instrument, we will face
another problem: Is

Z1

an instrument?

We have pointed out that this question cannot be an­
swered if we only have the joint distribution of

Z1, X,

andY. However, from the Bayesian point of view, with
some further assumption, if there is a second semi­
instrument, say, z2' we might be able to determine

Here we might also want to do a bootstrap estimation
of the distribution of RN- RA. If we adopt this approach,
we could generate bootstrap samples by adding permuta­
tions of the residuals obtained by regressing Y on E[XID]
and ex to the fitted values ofY obtained from the same
regression.

whether Z1 and Z2 are both instruments. (If not both
of them are instrument, we would not be able to tell
whether both are non-instrumental, or only one is non­
instrumental. ) The following theorem gives the condi­
tion when two semi-instruments are both instruments
almost surely.
Let Z1 and Z2 be two independent ran­
dom variables that are both semi-instruments for X
and Y. Let a1 and a2 be the linear coefficients of Z1
and Z2 respectively. Suppose a1 and az are indepen­
dent, and each has a distribution function that has one
and only one point of discontinuity, 0. 7 If Z1 and Z2
have the same linear coefficients, then with probability
1, Z1 and Z2 are both instruments.

Theorem 2

For the proof, see the appendix.
Assume that the sample S was generated from the
causal structure illustrated in figure 3, and that both
Z1 and Z2 are semi-instruments for X andY. We can
use the following algorithm, called the double instru­
ments testing algorithm, to test whether Z1 and Z2
have the same linear coefficient: 8
1. Create a new variable Z ft (Z1) + h(Z2), where
ft(Zt) == E[XIZ1], !2(Z2) = E[XIZ2].
=

2. Test whether Z is a semi-instrument.
This algorithm is based on the following observation:
Assume that g1 and gz are differentiable, and that Z1
and Z2 have a joint density. Then g1(ZI) + 92(Z2) =
a(ft(Z1) + h (Z2)) + b for some (a,b) iff g1(Z1) =
aft (Z1) + b1 and g2(Z2) = af2(Z2) + b2 for some
b1 + b2 =b. 9

testing and double instrument testing. It turns out
that, in order for the semi-instrument testing to
work, we need to find a better additive regression
method that can handle dependent predictors, which
seems currently not available. However, the double­
instruments testing algorithm does work for a subset
of additive models: the models where the influence of
X on Y is linear. This subset includes a very impor­
tant class of models: the linear models. 10
4.1

SEMI-INSTRUMENT TESTING

The semi-instrument testing algorithm requires a sur­
face smoother and an additive smoother. We use the
Splus functions loess as the surface smoother, and
gam as the additive smoother. The gam function im­
plements the back-fitting algorithm proposed in Hastie
et al (1990). The loess function is an implementation
of the local polynomial regression. We use BIC score
function to score the fitted models returned by gam
and loess respectively.
We generate 6 samples from the following 2 models:

7
Note that here by imposing a distribution on a1 and
a2, which are actually parameters of our models, we have
adopted a Bayesian perspective. Also, the conditions for
the distribution are stronger than required. What we really

need is to ensure that the P(at == a2) = P(at = a2 = 0) >
0. That is, we want to assume that it is possible that
a1 = a2, and if a1 = a2, it is almost sure that a1 = a2 = 0,
which means that both Zt and Z2 are instruments.
8
Note that from the classical point of view, this algo­
rithm can be used to reject the null hypothesis that Zt and
Z2 are both instruments in the cases where Zt and Z2 have
different linear coefficients. However, to make it a testing
algorithm for double instruments, a certain Bayesian as­
sumption about the prior distributions of the linear coeffi­
cients of Zt and Z2, like the one proposed in Theorem 2,
is required.

isfied. While in general we cannot test whether
a random variable satisfies all the first three semi­
instrumental conditions, it is interesting to know
whether we can test for one of them, especially the
second semi-instrumental condition: Z is an exogenous
variable. The answer is: in principle, this assumption
can be tested by the method of instrument, if we have
an instrument for Z and X. However, it is easy to see
that this will lead to an infinite regression.
Another assumption key to the double instruments
testing algorithm is: The prior probability that Z is
instrumental is positive, while the prior probability is
0 for a semi-instrument to have linear coefficient a if
a -::/::- 0.
This raises a question: Why does the value
0 have a special status in the range of possible values
of the linear coefficients of a semi-instrument? Here
we want to give an argument for the plausibility of
this assumption: If we take the set of possible causal
structures among X, Y, Z1 and Z2 as a discrete sample
space, it is reasonable to assign a positive prior prob­
ability to one element in the space, i.e., the structure
where both Z1 and Z2 are instruments, which means
that both Z1 and Z2 have linear coefficients 0. On the
other hand, if a semi-instrument is not an instrument,
there is no specific reason to believe that its linear co­
efficient should take any specific non-zero value.
We make a third assumption in an effort to modify the
double instruments testing algorithm so that it has suf­
ficient power: We assume that the direct effect of X
on Y is a linear function of X. We notice that this is a
rather strong assumption for an additive model. More­
over, because currently we do not have a suitable addi­
tive regression method for the semi-instrument testing,
we also have to assume, without any testing, that Z1
and Zz are semi-instruments. Nevertheless, the mod­
ified double instruments testing algorithm is general
enough to provide a double instruments test for linear
models.

FUTURE WORK

To make the semi-instrument testing powerful, we will
continue to look for some additive regression method
that is suitable for the case where the predictors are
dependent. 14 Alternatively, we may also try to find
some new ways of testing semi-instruments where the
problem of the dependence of the predictors will not
significantly affect the test results.

Tom Minka suggested that by letting the back-fitting
algorithm run for a sufficient number of iterations, it will
eventually return a good fitted model, or we can use least

squares to the the best fitted model directly ( without iter­
ations ) . We have yet to test whether this will work.

Proof of Theorem 1 .

Because (X, Ex) has a joint density, and j, g, s , and h
are differentiable, it immediately follows that E[Y]X =
x, Ex = u] is differentiable with respect to X and t:x
with probability one.
Also note that E[Y]X

=

x, Ex =u]

=E[s(X) +g(Z)) +t:y]X =x, EX = u]
=

s(x) +E[g(Z)]j(Z)

because conditional on f(Z) =X� Ex =x
is independent of X =x and t:x =u

g(Z)

It is easy to see that if g(Z) aj(Z) +b, i.e., the direct
effect of Z on Y is a linear function of the direct effect
of Z on X, then with probability one, E[Y]X, t:x] =
s(X) +aX + h(Ex) � at:x + b, i.e., E[Y]X, t:x] is a
linear combination of a univariate function of X and
a univariate function of t:x. Moreover, we have:
=

Var(Y]E[X]Z], Ex)
=Var(s(j(Z) +EX) +g(Z) +Ey lf(Z), Ex )
=

=

Var(t:ylf(Z), ex)

=

Var(t:yjt:x)

Var(Ey]Z,t:x) = Var(Y]Z,t:x)

To show the converse, suppose:
E[Y]X

=

x,t:x =u]

Let g0(x� u)

Note that the assumption that Var(YjE[XjZ], t:x) =
Var(Y]Z,ex) implies that Var(g(Z)]j(Z)) = 0, which
again implies that g(Z) E[g(Z)]j(Z)] w.p.l. There­
