A semantics is given to possibilistic logic, a
logic that handles weighted classical logic
formulae, and where weights are interpreted as
lower bounds on degrees of certainty or
possibility, in the sense of Zadeh's possibility
theory. The proposed semantics is based on fuzzy
sets of interpretations. It is tolerant to partial
inconsistency. Satisfiability is extended from
interpretations to fuzzy sets of interpretations,
each fuzzy set representing a possibility
distribution describing what is known about the
state of the world. A possibilistic knowledge base
is then viewed as a set of possibility distributions
that satisfy it. The refutation method of automated
deduction in possibilistic logic, based on
previously introduced generalized resolution
principle is proved to be sound and complete with
respect to the proposed semantics, including the
case of partial inconsistency.

INTRODUCTION

Possibilistic logic is a logic of uncertainty tailored for
reasoning under incomplete information. At the syntactic
level, it handles formulas of propositional or first-order­
logic to which lower bounds of degrees of necessity (i.e.
certainty) or possibility are attached. The degrees of
possibility follows the rules of possibility theory (Zadeh,
1978 ; Dubois and Prade, 1988) and the degrees of
necessity are defined from degrees of possibility through a
classical duality relationship. A possibilistic knowledge
base can thus be viewed as a stratified (or layered) classical
knowledge base, where some formulae are more certain, or
more possible than others. Resolution rules have been
derived in accordance with the axioms of possibility theory
(Dubois and Prade, 1987, 1990a) and a refutation technique
has been implemented for necessity-valued formulas
(Dubois,Prade and Lang, 1987) further on extended to both
possibility and necessity-valued formulas (Lang, 1991).
The main ideas behind possibilistic logic are: i) the degree
attached to a proof path in a possibilistic knowledge-base
is the least degree attached to a formula in this proof path,
and the degree attached to a consequence of a possibilistic

knowledge base is the greatest degree attached to proof­
paths yielding this consequence ; ii) when two
antagonistic propositions p and --.p can be derived, the one
with the highest degree inhibits the other one. The latter
point indicates that possibilistic logic can handle partial
inconsistencies. Moreover possibilistic logic proposes a
way of handling uncertainty based on the idea of ordering
rather than counting, contrary to probabilistic logic.
This paper presents a semantics for possibilistic logic in a
fairly general situation, i.e. possibility or necessity-valued
clauses, and the presence of partial inconsistency, are
allowed. It extends a previous semantics dedicated to
necessity-valued propositional clauses only (Dubois et a!.,
1989). This semantics is based on an extension of the
satisfiability notion from sets of interpretations to fuzzy
sets of interpretations. The idea of a fuzzy set of
interpretations is that some interpretations are preferred to
others and enable non-trivial inferences that could not be
made if interpretations were equally considered. In this
sense, possibilistic logic belongs to the family of non­
monotonic logics based on preferential models, whose
general setting has been devised by Shoham (1988); see
Dubois and Prade (1991) on this point. Possibility
distributions are viewed here as a convenient way of
encoding a preference relation by attaching a weight to
each interpretation of a set of formulas. Possibilistic logic
completely contrasts with Ruspini (1991)'s so-called
"fuzzy logic" where the semantics relies on the idea of
similarity rather than ordering. Ruspini's logic is one of
graded indiscernibility between worlds (in the spirit of
Pawlak (1982)'s rough sets) while possibilistic logic is a
logic of preference between interpretations.
Possibilistic logic is closely related to Shackle (1961)'s
degrees of potential surprize, and Spohn (1988)'s ordinal
conditional functions. See Dubois and Prade (1990b) on
this latter point. Possibility measures can also be viewed
as consonant belief functions (Shafer, 1976). However,
possibilistic logic is not a truth-functional many-valued
logic and is not a logic of vagueness (as is fuzzy logic)
because it primarily pertains to non-fuzzy propositions the
truth of which is uncertain due to incomplete information.
In the next section, a language and a semantics are
presented for possibilistic logic, a logic of necessity and

A Logic of Graded Possibility and Certainty Coping with Partial Inconsistency

possibility-valued (classical) formulas. A version of the
semantics, in terms of a possibility distribution on a set
of interpretations for the case of consistent knowledge
bases is first presented, where consistency refers to the
proper assignment of the possibility and necessity degrees
(with respect to the axioms of possibility and necessity
measures). A generalized semantics, where an extra­
element representing the absurd interpretation is added to
the referential of the possibility distribution, is then
introduced in order to allow for inconsistencies. Section 3
describes an automated deduction procedure based on
extended resolution and refutation. Completeness of the
deduction procedure holds, with respect to the proposed
semantics.

POSSIBILISTIC LOGIC :
LANGUAGE AND SEMANTICS
LANGUAGE

A possibi/istic formula is either a pair (q> (N a)) where q>
is a classical first-order formula and aE (0,1], (a should
be StriCtly positive) or a pair (q> (fl�)) where�E [0,1].
(<p (N a)) expresses that <p is certain at least to the degree
a, i.e. N(<p) � a , and (<p err �)) expresses that <p is
possible at least to the degree �.i.e. IT(cp) ��.where rr
and N are dual measures of possibility and necessity
modelling our incomplete state of knowledge (Zadeh,
1978 ; Dubois and Prade, 1988). The right part of a
possibilistic formula, i.e. (N a) or err�). is called the
valuation of the formula, and is denoted val(<p).
The basic axiom of a possibility measure IT is fl(<p v <p') =
max (IT(<p ),IT( cp')) (on a finite language ;£,- on which
formulas are defined). Informally, fl(<p) =0 means that <p
is impossible while IT(<p) = I means that <p is consistent
with current knowledge. Particularly fl(<p) =0 when <p is a
contradiction. The necessity measure N is defined as N(<p)=
1 - ITC�cp), and is such that N(<p 1\ <p') =min(N(<p),N(cp')).
N(<p) 1 means that <p is sure ; for instance N(<p) =1
when cp is a tautology. Since V <p, N(<p v �cp) =1, we
only have N(<p v cp') � max(N(<p),N(<p')); indeed, for <p' =
�cp, we may have N(cp) N(�<p) =0 (i.e. IT(cp) IT(�cp) =
1). It can be shown that N(<p) � IT(cp), generally. More
specifically, IT(cp) = 1 as soon as N(<p) > 1. This is due to
the axioms that force IT(cp v �cp) =1 =max(IT(<p),IT(�cp)).
When fl(<p) IT(�cp) =1, we capture a state of ignorance
about <p. Hence since we use lower bounds on possibility
or necessity measures, various cases of relative ignorance
can be captured ranging from the case where we know that
we do not know (IT(<p) rrc�cp) =1) to the case where we
do not know if we know errCcp) � 0, TI(-,<p) � 0). Let CJ,f
be the set of all possible valuations of possibilistic
formulas. Since N(<p) > 0 entails TI(cp) = 1, and the
valuations act as lower bounds, (<p (N a)) is stronger than
(<p err�)) for any a > 0,� � 0 ; this leads us to define the
following ordering among valuations :
(N a)� (N�) iff a �� ; err a)� err�) iff a�� ;
(IT a)� (N�) Va, V� > 0.
Hence the maximal and minimal elements of o/ are
respectively (N 1) (expressing that a formula is completely
=

=

=

=

=

certain) and en 0) (corresponding to the strongest form of
ignorance, since fl(<p) � 0 only). A possibilistic
knowledge base is then defined as a finite set (a
conjunction) of possibilistic formulae. ff"* will denote
the set of classical formulae obtained from a set of
possibilistic formulae fF, by ignoring the weights. A
possibilistic formula whose valuation is of the form (N a)
(resp. err a)) will be called a necessity-valued (resp.
possibility-valued) formula. Let LP 1 (resp. LP2) denote
the language consisting of only necessity-valued formulae
(resp. where possibility-valued formulae are also allowed).

SEMANTICS

UNDER

CONSISTENCY

Let ;£,- be a classical language associated with the set ff"*
of classical formulae obtained from a set fF of
possibilistic formulae, and let Q be the set of (classical)
interpretations for ;£,- . Let ;£,- ' be the set of closed
formulae of ;£,- .
Then we define a possibility distribution 1t as a mapping
from Q to [0,1] such that 3 ro E Q, n(ro ) = 1
(normalization). This possibility distribution represents
the description of an incomplete state of knowledge, such
that n(ro) = 0 means that ro is forbidden while n(ro') >
n(ro) means that ro' is an interpretation preferred to ro.
The normalization constraint expresses the natural
requirement that there should exist at least one fully
possible interpretation in Q with respect to a consistent
(possibly incomplete) state of knowledge. The possibility
measure IT. induced (in the sense of Zadeh (1978)) by the
possibility distribution 1t is the function from ;£,-' to [0,1]
defined by V cpE ;£,- ', IT(cp) =Sup(n(ro), ro F= <p} 1 where
ro F= <p means "ro is a model of cp". The dual necessity
measure N induced by 1t is defined by V <pE ;£,- ', N(cp) =
1 - Il(-,cp) =Inf (1 - n(ro), ro F= -,cp} 1. Then, it can be
seen that expressing constraints of the form N(<p) �a or
Il(cp) � � is equivalent to specify a set of possibility
distributions over Q which are compatible with the
corresponding possibilistic formulae. A possibility
distribution 1t on Q is said to satisfy the possibilistic
formula (<p (N a)), iff N(<p) �a, where N is the necessity
measure induced by n. We shall then use the notation 1t F=
(<p (N a)). In the same manner, we write 1t F= (<p err�)) iff
Il(cp) ��.where IT is the possibility measure induced by
l . .. n} be a set of possibilistic
n. Then, let fF =(<Pi , i
=

formulae <l>i =(<p i vi ) where <p iE ;£,-' and ViE o/; a
possibility distribution 1t is said to satisfy ff", i.e. 1t F= ff",
iff V i = 1, ... ,n, 1t satisfies <l>i . Then, a possibilistic
formula <l> is said to be a logical consequence of the set of
possibilistic formulae fF iff any possibility distribution
satisfying fF also satisfies <l>, i.e. V 1t, (7t F= ff) ==>
(1t F= <l>).
Example: let fF ((p (N 0.7)), (-,pv q (n 0.8))}.

numbers defined between {)

iff N(p) � 0.7 and fl(-,p v q) � 0.8
iffinf{1 - 1t(CO), co 1= -,p) � 0.7 and
Sup{1t(ro), co 1= -,p v q) � 0.8.
Let [p, q], [-,p, q], [p, -,q] and [-,p, -,q] be the 4 different
interpretations for the propositional language generated by
{p, q) (where [p, q] gives the value True to p and q, etc.).
Then, it comes down to
1t I= ff iff 1t ([-,p, ql):::; 0.3, 1t ([-,p, -,q]):::; 0.3,
1t ([p, ql) � 0.8, max (1t ([p, q]), 1t ([p, -,q]) ) = 1.
Indeed fl(-,p):::; 0.3 and fl(-,p v q) � 0.8
¢'> max(1t(-,p" q), 1t(-,p" -,q)):::; 0.3,
max(1t(p " q), 1t(-,p" q), 1t(-,p" -,q)) � 0.8,
max(1t(p" q), 1t(-,p" q), 1t(p"-,q), 1t(-,p "-,q)) =1
¢'> 1t(-,p 1\ q) :::; 0.3, 1t(-,p 1\ -,q) :::; 0.3,
1t(p 1\ q) � 0.8, max(1t(p" q), 1t(p" -,q)) = 1.
It is then obvious that ff 1= (q (Il 0.8)). Indeed, any
possibility distribution 1t satisfying ff is such that
1t ([p, ql) � 0.8, and thus verifies fl(q) = max(1t ([p, q]),
1t ([-,p, ql)) � 0.8 ; hence 1t satisfies (q (Il 0.8)).
•
It is worth noticing that in LP1 there is an equivalence
between the consistency of the classical set of formulae
ff* and the existence of a greatest normalized possibility
distribution 1t satisfying ff, as shown in (Dubois et al.,
1989). Indeed if 1t is normalized it can be easily checked
that 'v'<p, min(N(<p),N(-,<p)) = 0 where N is defined from 1t;
in other words it is impossible that there exists <p such
that both <p and -,<p have a strictly positive lower bound
for their necessity degrees (i.e. that both <p and -,<p appear
in the deductive closure of ff*).
Our semantics is similar to Nilsson's (1986) probabilistic
logic semantics. Indeed this author considers a set of
probability distributions on the set of interpretations n,
defining probability measures on the set of closed
formulas � ' , which are compatible with bounds
constraining the probability of formulae in the knowledge
base. The notions of logical consequences are similar in
both approaches.
2. 3

EXTENDING THE SEMANTICS T O
PARTIAL INCONSISTENCIES

Let us first take an example
let '()
{(-,p v r (N 0.6)), (...., q v ...., r (N 0.9)), (p (N 0.8)),
(q (N 0.3)). It can be checked that 1t 1= y iff
1t ([p, q, r]):::; 0.1;
1t ([p, q, ....,r]):::; 0. 4;
1t ([p, -,q, r]):::; 0.7 ;
1t ([p, -,q, -,r]):::; 0.4;
1t ([-,p, q, r]):::; 0.1;
1t ([-,p, q, -,r]):::; 0.2;
1t ([-,p, -,q, r]):::; 0.2;
1t ([-,p, -,q, -,r]):::; 0.2;
Sup{1t(ro), co E Q) = I.
This set of constraints being unsatisfiable (because of the
normalization constraint), there is no possibility
distribution over n satisfying '() , which comes down to
say that y is inconsistent. As a consequence, any
possibilistic formula is a logical consequence of y .
However, it would not be fully satisfactory to define a
logic which handles degrees of uncertainty without
allowing for degrees of (partial) inconsistency. Indeed, if
we consider the above example where we suppose that p, q

and r respectively express "the hostages will be freed" (p);
"Peter is going to be the victim of an affair" (q) ; "Peter
will be elected" (r) respectively. Then the formulas
contained in ff express that it is moderate! y certain that if
the hostages are freed then Peter will be elected, that it is
almost certain that if Peter is victim of an affair then he
will not be elected, that it is rather certain that the
hostages are going to be freed and that it is weakly certain
that Peter will be the victim of an affair. The
inconsistency comes from the beliefs of the experts who
gave the information stored in the knowledge base.
However, the expert who gave the last formula was only
weakly certain of what he said, so that the inconsistency
should be relativized.Since the first three formula of'() are
strictly more certain than the last one, we would like our
logic to behave as if the set of formulas were only
partially inconsistent, its inconsistency degree being the
valuation of the weakest formula involved in the
contradiction ; then, the deduction of a formula with a
valuation strictly greater than this inconsistency degree
should still be permitted ; since this deduction would
involve only a consistent part of the knowledge base made
here of the most certain pieces of information in the
example, we should still be able to deduce (r (N 0.6)) non­
trivially; this is done inSection 3. However a conclusion
deduced from a partially inconsistent knowledge base
should be regarded as more brittle than what is derived
from a consistent one.
We are now going to give a semantics which handles such
partial inconsistencies. The problem with the first
semantics is that according to the definition of possibility
and necessity measures we have (if .l denotes the
contradiction): fl(.l) = Sup(1t(ro), OJ 1= .l} =Sup 0 = 0
and N(.l) = Inf{l - 1t(CO), co I= -,.l) = 1 - Sup(1t(ro),
co E Q) = 0. Hence the solution requires that non-zero
values for fl(.l) and N(.l) be allowed.
The solution we propose consists in adding to the set of
interpretations Q an extra-element, noted OJ .l in which
any formula is "true", i.e. V <p E �',co .Li= <p which
corresponds to the idea of an "absurd interpretation"
discussed by Stalnaker (1968)2 Let Q.l = Q u {OJ.Ll· A
possibility distribution on n .l is a mapping ii from n .l
to [0,1] such that :1 CO E Q .l, ii(CO) = I (normalization
over n.L)· Then we define two functions from �'to [0,1]
,..
induced by 1t: fl(<p) = Sup{1t(CO), (!) E n.l, (!)I= <p);
N"(<p) = Inf{l - n(ro), co E Q .l• co FF <p). Note that N"(<p)
does not take ii(OJ_L) into account, while n(<p) does ;

2The idea of adding an extra-element to the
referential of a possibility distribution has been already used
for dealing with the case of an attribute which does not apply
to an item of a data base. However the extensions of the
possibility and necessity measures which are used for the
evaluations of queries in incomplete information databases
differ from the extensions defined here ; see chapter 6 of
Dubois and Prade (1988).

A Logic of Graded Possibility and Certainty Coping wifu Partial Inconsistency

particularly �(<p) = inf(l- it(ro), ro E Q, ro F= -,cp}, and
�(.l) = 1- sup(it(ro), ro E Q} ;:;: 0 ; note also that
ro Fj= <p is no longer equivalent to ro F= -,cp, since ro_1_ F=
<p and ro.l F= -,cp .

As it can be easily seen, we have
'd <p E ;t.', n(<p) = maxm(.l), I - �(-,<p)]
Note that n and � are not possibility and necessity
measures with respect to Q, but only with respect to Q.l·

We now give the inconsistency-tolerant semantics of
possibilistic logic. Each possibilistic formula (<p (Il a))
or (<p (N a)), is now considered as meaning n(<p) <::a
(respectively �(<p) <:: a), i.e. we take into account the
absurd interpretation in our understanding of expert
statement. For instance, (<p (IT a)) expresses that "it is
possible at least to the degree a that either <p is true or we
are in an absurd situation". This leads us to the following
definitions :
s a tisfaction : it � (<p (I1 a)) iff n (<p);:;: a ; it �
(<p (N a)) iff �(<p);:;: a, where nand � are the extended
possibility and necessity measures induced by it ; it �
fF iff it satisfies all formulae of fF ;
- logical consequence : fF � <l> iff '<lit, it� fF implies
it � <l>.
The inconsistency-tolerant semantics is more general than
the first one we introduced. In the case of a consistent
possibilistic knowledge base fF (i.e., there exists a
possibility distribution 1t over Q satisfying fF according
to the first semantics), then the two logical consequence
relations F= and � are equivalent. This is no longer true if
fF is inconsistent (this is the property we wished). For
instance, let us consider again l'J = ((-,p v r (N 0.6)),
(-,q v -,r (N 0.9)), (p (N 0.8)), (q (N 0.3)} which is
inconsistent according to the first semantics ; then,
according to the inconsistency-tolerant semantics, l'J is
consistent since we can find a possibility distribution on
Q _1_ satisfying l'J . For example the possibility
distribution,

fio defined by

it o ([p, q, r]) O.l ;
ito ([p, -,q, r]) = 0.7 ;
=

it ([-,p, q, r1) = 0.1 ;
0
ito ([-,p, -,q, r]) = 0.2 ;
it0 (roj_) = 1,

it0 ([p, q, -,r]) = 0.4 ;

going to show it, we can distinguish between two different
types of partial inconsistencies.
Let fF be a set of possibilistic formulae ; considering the
possibility distributions on Q _1_ satisfying fF , three
situations may occur :
3 it � fF such that it(ro_]_) = 0 : in this case, fF is
(i)

(ii)

consistent in both semantics ; fF is then said to be
completely consistent.
V it � fF, it(roj_) > 0 but 3 it � fF such that

I : then, for any it
satisfying fF , we have n(_l_) = it(OO_j_) > 0 and
�(_!_) = 1 - Sup (it(ro), ro * ro_1_) = o. Thus fF
S u p ( it(ro ), ro

possibility distributions it on Q_!_ satisfying fF
gives the inconsistency

degree of fF . Let

a= Inf( n(_l_), it � fF) ; then Incons(fF) = (I1 a).
(iii) V it � fF, Sup(it (ro), ro * roj_} < 1 (which entails
that V it � fF, neroj_) = 1). In this case, for any it
satisfying fF , we have n(_l_) = it(OO_j_) = 1 and
�(.l) = 1 - Sup(it(ro), ro * OO_j_} > o. Thus fF

induces a "(somewhat) necessary inconsistency" ; the
minimal value of � (_!_) among the possibility
distributions it on Q_!_ satisfying fF will give us the
inconsistency degree of fF . Let a = Inf(�(.l),
it � fF) ; then Incons(fF) = (N a).
fF is thus characterized by its inconsistency degree which
is a valuation of the form (I1 a) or (N a) ; if fF is
completely consistent then Incons(fF ) = (IT 0). If
V it � fF, Sup(it(ro), ro * ro_]_} = 0 then Incons(fF) =

(N 1) and fF is completely inconsistent. If Incons(fF) =
(I1 a) with a > 0 or Incons(fF) = (N �) with � < I then
fF is partially inconsistent.
The following scale shows
inconsistencies: (see Figure 1)

(N 1)

ito ([-,p, q, -,r]) = 0.2;

satisfies lJ . Moreover, since y is not inconsistent
according to the inconsistency-tolerant semantics, any
formula can no longer be derived from y contrary to what
happened with the first semantics. For example we have
lJ � (r (N 0.6)) but we do not have g � (r (N 0.7)) ;
indeed it o � lJ but we do not have no � (r (N 0.7)).
Hence the new semantics is definitely more tolerant to
inconsistencies than the former one. When a set of
possibilistic formulae fF is inconsistent in the sense of
the first semantics but not in the sense of the second, then
we shall say that fF is partially inconsistent. As we are

roj_) =

induces a "possible inconsistency" (contradiction
being possible to a strictly positive degree). The
minimal value of n(_l_) = it(roj_) among the

The knowledge base y gives an example of a degree of

the set (j I TI(<pj) < �jl as small as possible. Let it be

Clearly, it 1= {(<p i (N ai)), i = l ,m}, 3 wE Q, it(w)

max{�j I I1(<flj) < �j} where I1 is based on it. Note that
the maximality of it over Q minimizes the number of
(<flj (I1 �j)) with I1(<flj) < �j·

The examples indicate that the inconsistency degree of a
possibilistic knowledge base ff is the valuation of the
least formula (in the sense of the ordering in 9f) involved
in the strongest contradiction in ff. Let wE 9f such that
I n c o n s ( ff ) = w. It is easy to see that 'd <l> E ff ,
Incons(ff - {<I>}) ::;; w. Let ff' � ff such that Incons(ff') =
Incons(ff) and 'd <I> E ff', Incons(ff' - {<l>}) < Incons(ff').
ff' is called a smallest maximally inconsistent subset of
ff. Then the following result holds :

Proposition I : The inconsistency of a possibilistic
knowledge base ff is the smallest weight of possibilistic
formulas in any smallest maximally inconsistent subset
ff• of ff. More precisely, if Incons(ff) = (N a) then there
exists at least one formula (<p (N a )) E ff' and
'd (<p' w)E ff', w ;:,: (N a). If Incons(ff) = (I1 �) then
there is a unique possibility-valued formula in ff' of the
form (<p (I1 �)).
Proof:
i) Incons ( fF) = (N a). Assume ff• = {(<p i (N a i )),
i = 1,m} u {(<fl j (I1 � j), j = m + 1, . . . ,n}. The
inconsistency degree is
a= 1 - SUPw"#W_j_ n(w)

under the constraints
� (<fl ) 2': a , i = 1,m
i
i
n (<flj) 2': �j· j = m + 1, . . . , n
Since a> 0, n(w_1_) = 1 and the constraints n (<flj) 2':
� j are ever satisfied. Hence Incons(ff ') =
Incons{(<fli (N ai)), i = l ,m}. The minimality of ff' is
thus contradictory with the presence of possibility­
valued formulas in ff '. Thus ff ' is of the form
{(<fli (N ai)), i = 1,n}. By assumption any possibility
distribution it satisfying ff' is such that n(w)::;; 1 -a
for all w * w_1_. Assume a1 = mini= 1,m ai . Let us
prove that a1 = a. 7t satisfies ff' if and only if 'd i,
n(w)::;; 1 -ai, 'd w I= •<fl i· w * w_j_ ; in other words,
'dit, it� ff implies 'd w I= •<fl1 v '<fl2··· v •<fln•

tautology (otherwise ff' would not be inconsistent),
'd wE Q, n(w)::;; 1 - a1 is due ton � ff '. Hence
the inequalitya 2':a1· Now let 1t be defined by
it(w) = 1 -a1 if w 1= <fl 2" <fl3··· "<fl n· w "'<OJ.,
n(w)::;; 1 - ai if w I= •<fli· w "'w_!_·
Because <fl 2 "<fl3··· " <fln ;o'_l_, 3w, it(w) = 1- a1.
and it� ff.Hencea=a1 .
ii) lncons(fF) = ([J /3). It is obvious that ff' contains at
least one possibility valued formula. Let us show that
it is unique. The inconsistency degree is now of the
form :

For simplicity assume � k = � m+1· Let us put it(w_j_) =
� m + 1 . Then clearly, it � ff ', since 'd j ,
m a x (� m + 1 • I1(<fl j)) 2': � j by construction. Thus
Incons(ff')::;; � m +1· Now, 'd<flj such that TI(<pj) 2': �j·
Incons(ff' - {(<p (I1 �j)}) = Incons(ff') ; the same thing is
true for all <flj such that I1(<flj) < �j < � m +1· If there is
another formula (<fli (I1 �i)) such that �i = �m+1• dropping
one of these formulas still requires it (<O_j_) = �m+ 1 for
ensuring it � ff'. Hence, if ff • is really minimal it
contains only one possibility-valued formula, i.e. (<flm+ l
•
(I1 �m+1)) and Incons(ff') = (I1 �m+1 )·
Incons(ff) acts as a threshold inhibiting all deductions of
ff with a valuation::;; Incons(ff). Indeed, deductions such
as ff � (<p w) where w ::;; Incons(ff) are trivial since
ff � (<p w) comes directly from ff � (J. w) and the
inequalities n (<p) 2': n(J.) . �(<p) 2': �(_!_) (it easy to check
that if for any classical formulae <p and 1jf, if <p 1= 1jl then
n(<p) 2': n(1j!), �(<p) 2': � (1j!)). On the contrary, deductions
with a valuation strictly greater than Incons(ff) are not
caused by the partial inconsistency ; these deductions are
called non-trivial deductions.
Lastly, the following results are easy to prove (Lang,
1991) : If ff is a set of possibilistic formulae and w a
valuation of 9f, let us note ff w = {(<p v), v 2': w} and
ff w = {(<p v), v> w} ; then
(i) ff�(<pw) iff ffw�(<pw)
(ii) If Incons(ff) = w, ff is�-equivalent to ff w and to
ffw u ((_!_ w)}.

AUTOMATED DEDUCTION IN
POSSIBILISTIC LOGIC

Two well-known automated deduction methods have been
generalized to possibilistic logic : i) resolution (Dubois

A Logic of Graded Possibility and Certainty Coping with Partial Inconsistency

and Prade, 1990a) and ii) the Davis and Putnam semantic
evaluation procedure for propositional logic (Lang, 1990).
Here we focus only on resolution for which we give
soundness and completeness results.

where R(q ,c2) is a classical resolvent of q and c2, and *

err a) * en�) = en 0).

3.1

CLAUSAL FORM

In order to extend resolution to possibilistic logic, a
clausal form is first defined. A possibilistic clause is a
possibilistic formula (c w) where c is a first-order or
propositional clause and w is a valuation of 'V'. A
possibilistic clausal form is a conjunction of possibilistic
clauses. If a possibilistic formula fF contains only
necessity-valued classical formulae, then there exists a
clausal form G of fF such that Incons(G) = Incons(ff),
which generalizes the result holding in classical logic
about the equivalence between the inconsistency of a set of
formulae and the inconsistency of its clausal form. Indeed
possibilistic clausal form G of ff can be obtained by the
following method: if ff = ((ljli (N ai)), i= 1... n}, then
put each IPi into clausal form, i.e. IPi = (V)"j(Ci j) where
C ij is a universally-quantified classical clause ; then
(V)"i, j((C ij (N a i ))} is the possibilistic clausal form
equivalent to fF 3 . If fF contains also possibility-valued
formulae, then generally we cannot compute from fF a
clausal form having the same inconsistency degree as fF,
even in propositional possibilistic logic. For instance, the
closest clausal form we can compute from ff =
((p " q (IT a )), (-,p v -,q (N 1))} (a > 0) is C =
( (p (TI a)), (q (TI a)), (-,p v -,q (N 1))}, but it can be
checked that Incons(ff) =ena) whereas Incons(G) =
(IT 0). This negative result comes from the non­
compositionnality of possibility measures for conjunction.
Indeed (p "q ena)) is much stronger than (pena))"
(q en a)), since (p 1\ q en a)) means ncr 1\ q) � a, i.e.
3 co E Q.l such that co 1= p" q and ii(co) �a, whereas
(p en a)) 1\ (q en a)), means :leo, co' E Q.l SUCh that
co 1= p, co' 1= q and ii(co) �a, ii(co') �a. This problem,
also appears in modal logics (Farinas and Herzig, I988)
and can be similarly solved in our framework by
"coloring" the "IT" valuations. We denote respectively by
CLPI (resp. CLP2) the language consisting in necessity­
valued clauses only (resp. necessity- and possibility-valued
clauses).
3.2

POSSIBILISTIC RESOLUTION RULES

The following possibilistic resolution rule, between two
possibilistic clauses (q W I ) and (c2 w2), has been
established by Dubois and Prade (1987, 1990):
(CJ w1) (C2 w2)
(R)

3 Indeed, N(r,i(Cij)) 2: a is equivalent to min;[N(Cij))
2: a and thus to "'j[N(c;j) 2: a]; fF is then equivalent to

"'i("'j{(cij (N a;))]]. i.e. "ij{(Cij (N a;))].

The similarity between (R) and resolution patterns existing
in modal logics has been pointed out ; see (Dubois and
Prade, 1990). The following result can be easily checked
Proposition 2 (soundness of rule (R)) : let G be a set of
possibilistic clauses, and C a possibilistic clause obtained
by a finite number of successive applications of (R) to C ;
then C � C.
Proof:
(i) If C = (q (N a)), C' = (c2 (N �)), the application of
rule R yields C" (R(c l ,c2) (N min(a,�)). Then Vrc
satisfying C"C' we have l'l(c I ) �a and N(c2) � �.
=

and then l'l(cJ"c2) = min(N(q),l'l(c2)) �min(a,�)

and finally N(R(q,c2)) � 1\l(ci" c2) � min(a,�).
Thus rule R is sound in this case.
(ii) If C = (Cj (N a)), C' = (c2 en�)), rule R yields C" =
(R(q,c2) en(a * �)) ; if a+� � 1, a * � = 0 and
then trivially C, C' � C". If a + � > 1, Vii
satisfying C" C' we have l'l(q) �a and D(c2) �� ;
but ncc2) = max[ii(co_L), Il(c2)], then
- either ii(co.L) � � and then D(R(ci ,c2)) �� and
finally ii � C" ;
- or ii(co.L) <�. then ncc2) = Il(c2) ; in this case
Il(c2) = max[Il(-,cl"c2), Il(q"c2)l;

but l'l(q) �a entails Il(-,q) � I - a <�. then
Il(q"c2) �� and DCR(ci ,c2)) � Il(R(c l ,c2)) �
Il(q"c2) ��.and finally ii � C".

Then rule (R) is sound.

REFUTATION BY RESOLUTION

In this section we consider a set ff of possibilistic
formulae (the knowledge base) and a formula ljl ; we want
to know the maximal valuation with which ff entails <p,
i.e. Val(ff,<p) =Sup (wE 9f, ff � (<p w)).
This request can be answered by using refutation by
resolution, which is extended to possibilistic logic as
follows :
Refutation by resolution :
1. Put ff in clausal form C ;
2 . Put ljl in clausal form ; let CJ, ... , C
m be the
obtained clauses ;
3. C' � C u ((q (N I)), ..., (en (N 1))}
4. Search for a proof of (.l w) with w maximal , by
repeatedly applying the resolution rule (R) from C';
5. Val(fJ,<p) = w

194

Lang, Dubois, and B-ade

When the knowledge base consists of both necessity­
valued and possibility-valued formulae, then since the
transformation into clausal form is not complete (it does
not preserve the inconsistency degree), we shall suppose
that 5F is a set of possibilistic clauses ; in this case, C =
ff and step 1 is omitted. Soundness and completeness
results hold for possibilistic resolution. Let ff be a set of
possibilistic clauses, <p a classical formula, C' the set of
possibilistic clauses obtained as explained precedently.
Then we have the following results:
Proposition 3 Soundness and completeness of refutation in
clausal possibilistic logic :

ff � ( <p w) <=> Incons(ff1\ (---,<p (N 1))) �w
or equivalently: Incons(ff 1\ (-,<p (N 1))) = Val(ff,<p). See
the proof in Annex.

This result allows us to compute Val(ff,<p) by proving the
inconsistency of ff 1\ (-,<p (N 1)).

Note that in Proposition 3 we are not making use of
resolution. The two following propositions relate the
resolution procedure to the computation of the degree of
inconsistency.
Proposition 4 Soundness and completeness of refutation
by resolution in LP1 (Dubois, Lang and Prade, 1989) : let
ff be a set of necessity-valued first-order formulae and C
the set of necessity-valued clauses obtained from ff ; then
the valuation of the optimal refutation by resolution from
C (i.e. the greatest valuation of the obtained empty clause)
is the inconsistency degree of ff.

Corollary : let <p be a classical formula and C' the set of
possibilistic clauses obtained from ff u {(-,<p (N 1))) ;
then the valuation of the optimal refutation by resolution
from C' is Val(ff,<p). This corollary derives immediately
from Propositions 3 and 4.

Prwosition 5 Soundness and completeness of refutation

by resolution in propositional CLP2 : if C is a set of
propositional necessity- or possibility-valued clauses, then

the valuation of the optimal refutation by resolution from
C is the inconsistency degree of ff.

Corollary : let <p be a classical formula and C' the set of
possibilistic clauses obtained from C u {(-,<p (N 1))) ;
then the valuation of the optimal refutation by resolution
from C' is Val(C,<p).
Proposition 5 is a consequence of Propositions 3 and 1
together with the expression of the resolution rule.
N.B. : Proposition 5 does not hold for first-order
possibilistic clauses; for instance, if C = {(p(x) (Il a))), x
being a (universally quantified) variable and a> 0, and <p =
p(a) A p(b), then there is no (Il a)-refutation by resolution
from C A {(-,p(a) v -,p(b) (N 1))), whereas C �
(p(a) 1\ p(b) (I1 a)). It does not hold either for possibilistic
general formulas, since the tranlation into clausal form
does not preserve the inconsistency degree if the knowledge
base contains possibility-valued formulas. Completeness
can be recovered by indexing the "IT" symbols in the

(Il a)-valuations, in the same spirit as in modal logics
(Farinas and HeiZig, 1988)).
3.4

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

We now give an illustrative example. Let C be the
following knowledge base, concerning an election whose
two candidates are Mary and Peter :
(Elected(Peter) vElected(Mary) (N 1))
C1
(---,Elected(Peter) v-,Elected(Mary) (N 1))
C2
(-,Former-president(x) v Elected(x) (N 0.5))
C3
C4
(Former-president(Mary) (N I))
(-,Supports(John,x) v Elected(x) (N 0.6))
C5
(Supports(John, Mary) (I1 0.8))
C6
C7
(-,Victim-of-an-affair(x) v-,Elected(x) (N 0.9))
We cannot find any refutation from C ; hence, C is
consistent, i.e. Incons(C) = (Il 0). Let us now find the best
possibility or necessity degree of the formula
"Elected(Mary)". Let C'= C u {(-,Elected(Mary) (N 1)));
then there exist two distinct refutations by resolution from
C', which are:
(-,Elected (Mary) (N 1)) C3

------

(...,Former-president (Mary) (N 0.5))

4

(_1_ (N 0.5))
I OPTIMAL !
(-,Elected (Mary) (N 1)) C5

-----�C
6

(-,Sup

(_1_ (I1 0.8))
NON-OPTIMAL
Hence we conclude that C � (Elected(Mary) (N 0.5)), i.e.
it is moderately certain that Mary will be elected ; this
degree (N 0.5) is maximal, i.e. Val (C, Elected(Mary)) =
(N 0.5). Then, we learn that Mary is being the victim of
an affair (which is a completely certain information). This
leads us to update the knowledge base by adding to C the
possibilistic clause C 8 : (Victim-of-an-affair(Mary) (N !)).
Let C 1 be the new knowledge base, C1 = C u {C 8} . Then,
we can find a (N 0.5)-refutation from cl :
C8
C3
C4
C7

-------

(-,Elected (Mary) (N 0.9))

------

(Elected (Mary) (N 0.5))

-----(_1_ (N 0.5))

Hence ff1 is partially inconsistent, with Incons (CJ) =
(N 0.5).
The refutation which had given N (Elected(Mary) � 0.5 can
always be obtained from ff 1 but since its valuation is not
greater than Incons(ff J). it has become a trivial deduction.

A Logic of Graded Possibility and Certainty Coping with Partial Inconsistency

On the contrary, adding to fF 1 the possibilistic clause
(Elected(Mary) (N 1)), we find this time a (N 0.9)­
refutation. And, since (N 0.9) > Incons(fF1), we have the
non-trivial deduction fF1 � (-,Elected(Mary) (N 0.9)), and
it could be shown that we also have fF1 � (Elected(Peter)
(N 0.9)).
CONCLUSION

Possibilistic logic drastically differs from probabilistic
logic since the former is based on the ideas of ordering and
preference (only the ordering of numbers is used) while the
latter is b�sed on the ideas of measure and counting.
_ a logic of incomplete information
Possibiiistlc logic Is
_ more robust than classical logic, because it is
that Is
tolerant to inconsistency. Besides, as advocated elsewhere
possibilistic logic is in full accordance with current
theories of belief revision based on epistemic entrenchment
(Dubois and Prade, 1990b), and with the principles of non­
monotonic reasoning (Dubois and Prade, 1991). One of the
strength of possibilistic logic is that the proof methods in
�lassical logic still apply, even in the presence of partial
mconsistency, and keep all their power, as indicated by the
completeness results of this paper. This is would not be
the case with a similar probabilistic extension of logic.
Moreover efficient strategies for refutation methods have
also been implemented (Dubois et a!., 1987). Current
applications of possibilistic logic include hypothetical
reasoning (Dubois, Lang and Prade, 1990), logic
programming (Dubois, Lang and Prade, 1991), the
automated resolution of combinatorial optimization
problems with bottleneck-like objective functions (Lang,
1991) and belief revision.
Among topics for further research is the study of the links
between the semantics presented here and the Kripke-like
sem�ntics previously proposed for necessity and
possibility measures by Dubois, Prade and Testemale
(1988). Another issue is to bridge the gap between
possibilistic logic (especially the handling of possibility
degrees (Il a) ) and the semantics proposed by Yager
(1987) in default logic for defaults such as "if p is certain
and q is possible then r ". It would require to allow for
disjunctions of weighted formulas in the language.
