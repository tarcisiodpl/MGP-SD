networks for the diagnosis of a single fault. In this
paper, we examine modifications to the similaritynetwork representation that facilitate the construction of belief networks for the diagnosis of multiple
coexisting faults.

Introduction

A similarity network is a graphical extension of the
belief-network representation [4, 5]. The representation is a tool for constructing large and complex
belief networks of the form shown in Figure 1. In
this belief network, the chance node FAULT contains
many mutually exclusive and exhaustive instances.
This node conditions many other nodes, but is itself
not conditioned by any nodes. Belief networks of
this form are seen commonly in problems of diagnosis in which a single fault is present.
The similarity-network representation was instrumental in the construction of the belief network for
Pathfinder, a normative expert system for the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases [6, 7]. In Pathfinder’s
domain, the assumption that faults—the diseases—
are mutually exclusive is appropriate, because cooccurring diseases almost always appear in diﬀerent lymph nodes or in diﬀerent regions of the same
lymph node. In many domains, however, such an
assumption is invalid. Patients admitted to the
internal-medicine ward of a hospital, for example,
often present with four to five coexisting diseases.
In this paper, we examine how we can use the
similarity-network representations to facilitate the
construction of belief networks for the diagnosis of
multiple faults.

Similarity Networks

In this section, we use the similarity-network representation to construct a belief network for a small
problem in medical diagnosis. The purpose of this
exercise is to illustrate the basic concepts and techniques underlying this representation, and to demonstrate some of the advantages of its use. Because
the example is small, however, the full power of this
representation for simplifying knowledge acquisition
cannot be demonstrated. In [5], I describe highlights
of this approach to knowledge acquisition applied to
Pathfinder. There, the power of these representations is illustrated more fully.
The medical example that we examine is real, but
it has been simplified for purposes of presentation.
Dr. Harold Lehmann served as the expert for the domain. The figures in the example were generated by
SimNet, an implementation on the Macintosh computer of the similarity-network and partition representations. Readers interested in the details of SimNet’s operation should consult [5].

Figure 2: A belief network for sore throat.
Throughout the example, I will distinguish between the construction of a belief network, similarity
network, or partition by a person and the construction of these representations by an algorithm. Consequently, the terms to compose and to construct will
refer to situations where a person and an algorithm
generate a representation, respectively.
Suppose a patient between 5 and 18 years of age
comes to an emergency room complaining of severe
sore throat. A belief network for this situation is illustrated in Figure 2. The chance node DISEASE represents the causes of sore throat: VIRAL PHARYNGITIS, STREP THROAT, MONONUCLEOSIS, TONSILLAR
CELLULITIS, and PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS. Here,
we assume that these diseases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The remaining nodes represent
evidence relevant to the diagnosis of the patient’s
disease. We now discuss how to construct this belief
network using a similarity network.
The focus for the composition of the similarity
network is the distinguished node or distinguished
variable. For medical domains, the distinguished
variable represents a set of mutually exclusive and
exhaustive diseases. In general, we refer to the mutually exclusive exhaustive instances of this variable
as faults.
A similarity network consists of a similarity graph
and a collection of local belief networks. To compose
a similarity graph, we first compose the similarity
graph. The nodes in the similarity graph correspond
to individual faults. Informally, the edges in the
similarity graph connect faults that are similar. We
shall discuss soon the precise meaning of edges in
a similarity graph. The similarity graph for sore
throat is shown in Figure 3.
Next, we compose a local belief network for each
pair of faults that is connected in the similarity

Figure 3: A similarity graph for sore throat. Although the graph is a tree (i.e., there is exactly one
path between any two nodes in the graph), in general, similarity graphs can contain cycles.

graph. To compose a local belief network for the
fault pair fi and fj ,1 we imagine that one of these
two faults has occurred. Given this supposition, we
compose a belief network consisting of the distinguished node—whose instances are restricted to fi
and fj —and those nondistinguished nodes that are
relevant to the discrimination of these faults. Formally, we omit a node from the local belief network
if and only if the node would be disconnected from
the distinguished node (i.e., there would be no path
between the node and the distinguished node) if we
included it in the network. The distinguished node
must have no predecessors in a local belief network.
Figure 4(a) shows the local belief network for the
edge between PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS and TONSILLAR CELLULITIS in the similarity graph. The
small oval at the top of the belief network represents
the distinguished node whose instances are restricted
to these two diseases. The remaining nodes in the
local belief network represent the features or disease manifestations that are relevant to the discrimination the diseases PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS and
TONSILLAR CELLULITIS. Notice that there are no
arcs among the nondistinguished nodes. The missing arcs represent the assertion that, given that the
patient has either PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS or TONSILLAR CELLULITIS, all manifestations in the belief
network are independent. Also note that there are
fewer manifestations in this local belief network than
in the belief network for the entire domain (Figure 2). This observation tends to be true, in general,
because the diseases associated with local belief networks are similar.
1 In this paper we use lowercase letters to denote variables
and uppercase letters to denote sets of variables. We subscript
a variable (e.g., xi ) to denote an instance of that variable.
Similarly, we subscript a set of variables (e.g., Xi ) to denote
an instance of that set.

Figure 4(b) shows the local belief network for the
edge between STREP THROAT and VIRAL PHARYNGITIS in the similarity graph. Again, the belief
network contains fewer features than does the belief network for the sore-throat domain as a whole.
Now, however, some of the disease manifestations
are conditionally dependent. The arc from TONSILS
INVOLVED to TONSILLAR PUS reflects the expert’s
assertion that the probability of seeing pus on a patient’s tonsils depends on whether the disease involves one tonsil, both tonsils, or neither tonsil. The
arcs from FEVER and ABDOMINAL PAIN to TOXIC
APPEARANCE reflect the observation that a patient
is more likely to present with a toxic appearance if
the patient has abdominal pain or a high fever. Although FEVER is relevant to the discrimination of
STREP THROAT and VIRAL PHARYNGITIS indirectly
through its eﬀect on TOXIC APPEARANCE, the missing arc from the disease node to FEVER represents
the belief that temperature alone is not relevant to
the discrimination of the two diseases.
Given the similarity network that we have composed, we can now construct the belief network for
the full sore-throat problem, called the global belief
network. Specifically, we construct the global belief network by forming the graph union of the local

belief networks in the similarity network. The operation of graph union is straightforward. The nodes
in the graph union of a set of graphs is the simple
union of the nodes in the individual graphs. Similarly, the arcs in the graph union of a set of graph is
the simple union of the arcs in the individual graphs.
That is, a node (or arc) appears in the graph union,
if and only if there is such a node (or arc) in at least
one of the individual graphs.
The global belief network for sore throat was
shown in Figure 2. The node QUALITY OF VOICE,
for example, appears in the global belief network because it appears in the local belief network for PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS and TONSILLAR CELLULITIS.
The arc from DISEASE to ABDOMINAL PAIN appears
in the global belief network because it is present in
the local belief network for STREP THROAT and VIRAL PHARYNGITIS.
If (1) the global belief network contains no directed cycles, (2) the joint probability distribution
for the distinguished and nondistinguished variables
is strictly positive (i.e., there are no probabilities in
the distribution that are equal to zero), and (3) the
similarity graph is connected (i.e., there is a path
between any two nodes in the graph), then the construction of the global belief network from a simi-

larity network is sound [5]. That is, any joint distribution that satisfies the assertions of conditional
independence implied by the local belief networks
also satisfies the assertions of conditional independence implied by the global belief network.
The formal criteria for drawing edges in a similarity graph are that we connect two diseases only if we
can compose a local belief network for the disease
pair, and the similarity graph must be connected.
There is no formal requirement that connected diseases be similar. As we have seen in the medical
example, however, local belief networks for pairs of
similar diseases tend to exclude many of the features
that are relevant to the set of diseases as a whole.
Furthermore, by composing local belief networks for
pairs of similar diseases, the expert can use a similarity network to focus his attention on precisely those
diagnostic subproblems with which he is familiar.
Thus, an expert can simplify greatly his task of composing the local belief networks by connecting only
similar diseases in the similarity graph (provided the
graph remains connected).
We can extend the similarity-network representation to include local belief networks for fault sets of
arbitrary size. In such an extension, we replace the
similarity graph with a similarity hypergraph. A hypergraph consists of nodes and hyperedges that connect sets of nodes. We then compose one local belief network for each hyperedge. To ensure that the
global belief network constructed from such a similarity network is sound, we must replace only the
constraint that the similarity graph be connected,
using instead the constraint that the similarity hypergraph be connected.
A similarity network derives its power from its
ability to represent assertions of conditional independence that are not conveniently represented in
an ordinary belief network. To illustrate such an assertion, let f⊆ denote a proper subset of faults. If
f and feature x are independent, given that one of
the elements of f⊆ is present, we say that x is not
relevant to f⊆ . Formally, a feature x is not relevant
to the set f⊆ , given background knowledge ξ, if and
only if
p (fi |xk , f⊆ , ξ) = p (fi |f⊆ , ξ)
(1)
for all instances xk of variable x, and for all faults fi
in f⊆ . In Equation 1, the set f⊆ , which conditions
both probabilities, denotes the disjunction of its elements. We call the form of conditional independence
represented by Equation 1 subset independence. Using Bayes’ theorem, we can derive an equivalent criterion for subset independence. In particular, we
can show that a feature x is not relevant to the set
of faults f⊆ , given background knowledge ξ, if and

only if
p(xk |fi , ξ) = p(xk |fj , ξ)

(2)

for all pairs fi , fj ∈ f⊆ , and for all instances xk of
feature x.
Assertions of subset independence are asymmetric. In general, an assertion of conditional independence is asymmetric if it holds for only some
instances of its variables. Assertions of subset independence, in particular, hold for only proper subsets
of the disease variable f .
We cannot easily encode subset independence or
other forms of asymmetric conditional independence
in an ordinary belief network [5]. In contrast, such
assertions are represented naturally by local belief
networks. In particular, if we omit the feature x
from the local belief network for the faults fi and
fj , then we are asserting that x is not relevant to
the set {fi , fj }. In [5], I show how we can use these
assertions of conditional independence to facilitate
the assessment of the probability distributions associated with nodes in a belief network.

Belief
Networks
for
Multiple-Fault Diagnosis

Let us now consider the problem of multiple-fault diagnosis. Figure 5 contains a small portion of a belief
network for internal medicine. In this belief network,
the node APPI represents the absence or presence of
unreturned acute appendicitis. Similarly, the node
RUPTURED ECTOPIC represents the absence or presence of acute ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Thus, this
belief network does not exclude the possibility that
both diseases can manifest in the same patient.
This example illustrates a diﬃculty that arises
typically in situations where multiple faults are possible. In particular, both diseases in Figure 5 condition the node PERITONITIS, which represents the
absence or presence of an inflammatory response in
the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). Thus, without any additional information, we

would have to assess four probability distributions
for this manifestation. More generally, we can have
the situation, illustrated in Figure 6, where diseases
d1 , d2 , . . . dn can each cause manifestation m to appear. Here, the node m is associated with 2n probability distributions.

Assumption of Causal Independence

We can reduce dramatically the number of probability assessments for node m by making an additional
assertion of conditional independence, called causal
independence. In the context of Figure 6, let pi denote the probability that a patient, initially without
disease di and without manifestation m, will develop
manifestation m when getting disease di . When we
assert causal independence in this situation, we state
that probability pi does not depend on whether or
not the patient has any other diseases before he has
di , and that the manifestation m cannot disappear
when the disease di manifests in the patient.
Now let Da denote an arbitrary instance of the set
of variables D = {d1 , d2 , . . . , dn }. That is, let Da denote some assignment of absent or present to each
disease di . In addition, let D− denote the particular
instance of D where all diseases are absent. Given
the assertion of causal independence, the manifestation m will be absent in a patient only if two
conditions are met: (1) the manifestation m cannot
be present in the patient initially, and (2) none of
the patient’s diseases can act to cause m to appear.
Thus, we obtain
p (m− |Da , ξ) = p (m− |D− , ξ)

where m− denotes the absence of manifestation m,
and where Ia is the set of indices i such that di is

Thus, with the assertion of causal independence, we
can determine all the probability distributions associated with the node m in Figure °6, from only the
¢
probabilities p (m+ |D− , ξ) and p m+ |only di+ , ξ ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Good and other theorists have described various
forms of the causal-independence assertion [1, 11,
10]. Pearl refers to the particular form we have discussed, where diseases and features are binary, as
a noisy OR-gate [10]. (We consider the origin of
this name in the following paragraph.) Several researchers have noted that we can apply the noisy ORgate and more general forms of causal independence
to numerous situations within domains ranging from
medicine to motorcycle repair [2, 3, 9, 8].
The model of the noisy OR-gate, as we have examined it so far, makes reference to the appearance of
diseases over time. We can also represent the model
in a belief network, without such a reference, as illustrated in Figure 7. In the figure, the node labeled
di –causes–m represents the absence or presence of
an intermediate event through which di causes manifestation m to be present with certainty. As is indicated by the label OR above the deterministic node
m, if any of these intermediate events occur, then
the manifestation m will appear for certain (hence
the name noisy OR-gate). The arc from di to di –
causes–m reflects the assertion that the absence or
presence of di influences the probability distribution
for the variable di –causes–m.2 In particular, we assume that, if di is absent, then the disease cannot act
to cause m, whereas if di is present, then it causes m
to be present with some probability greater than 0.
This probability corresponds to pi in the temporal

we assume that the belief network is minimal.

formulation of the model. The lack of arcs between
nodes in the upper two rows of the influence reflects
the assertion of causal independence. In particular,
the missing arcs represent the statement that the
probability distribution for the variable di –causes–
m depends neither on the absence or presence of
any other disease nor on the absence or presence of
any other event leading to the occurrence of m. We
require the node d0 –causes–m to capture the possibility that manifestation m will appear when all
diseases are absent.
To make this model more concrete, let us consider
the simple medical example in Figure 5. In this example, acute ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause
peritonitis, because blood from the rupture of a fallopian tube can collect in the peritoneal cavity, and
thereby irritate the peritoneum. In contrast, the
presence of unreturned acute appendicitis is associated with the release of substances that mediate the
inflammatory response within the appendix. These
substances can leak out of the appendix, and thereby
cause an inflammatory response in the nearby peritoneum. Thus, the variable RUPTURED ECTOPIC–
causes–PERITONITIS refers to the absence or presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity, whereas the
variable APPI–causes–PERITONITIS refers to the absence or presence of inflammatory triggers of appendiceal origin in the peritoneum. To a good approximation, the probability that blood will collect in the
peritoneal cavity is influenced neither by the presence of an unreturned acute appendicitis nor by the
presence of inflammatory triggers of appendiceal origin in the peritoneum. Conversely, the probability
that inflammatory triggers from the appendix will
reach the peritoneum is influenced neither by the
presence of an acute ruptured ectopic pregnancy nor
by the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity.
Thus, we can assert causal independence for the interaction among these variables.

We can derive Equation 7 from both the temporal and atemporal models for causal independence.
The atemporal model is somewhat problematic, because we often cannot define events of the form di –
causes–m precisely. Nonetheless, most people find
this model easy to understand. In addition, we can
use the framework to extend causal independence to
situations where diseases and manifestations are not
binary [3, 8].

Construction of a MultipleFault Belief Network

Now let us examine how we can use assumptions of causal independence in conjunction with
an assessed similarity network to construct a belief network for the diagnosis of multiple diseases
(or faults). The construction derives from Equation 7, which states that the only probability assessments we need to define the interaction illustrated
in Figure 6¢ are those probabilities of the form
°
p m+ |only di+ , ξ , i = 1, 2, . . . , n and the probability assessment p (m+ |D− , ξ). These probabilities are
exactly those assessments that we can derive from a
similarity network where we represent each disease
as an instance of the distinguished node, and where
we include NORMAL to represent the instance D− .
With this observation in mind, let us consider the
similarity network shown in Figure 8(a). From this
similarity network, we can construct the multipledisease belief network shown in Figure 5, in the
following steps. First, we construct the global belief network from the similarity network, and transfer the manifestations ANOREXIA, PERITONITIS, and
VAGINAL BLEEDING in the global belief network to
the multiple-disease belief network. Also, if there
were any arcs between these manifestations, we
would transfer those arcs to the multiple-disease belief network. Second, for each node in the similarity graph, except NORMAL, we construct a binary
chance node in the multiple-disease belief network.
In particular, we construct the binary nodes APPI
and RUPTURED ECTOPIC. Third, in the multipledisease belief network, we draw an arc from APPI
to ANOREXIA, and from APPI to PERITONITIS. Conversely, we do not draw an arc from APPI to VAGINAL BLEEDING. We can omit this arc because the local belief network for APPI and NORMAL states that
the probability distribution for VAGINAL BLEEDING
given APPI is equal to the distribution for VAGINAL
BLEEDING given NORMAL, and because we assert
causal independence. Similarly, we draw arcs from
RUPTURED ECTOPIC to PERITONITIS and to VAGI-

NAL BLEEDING, but
RUPTURED ECTOPIC

we do not draw an arc from
to ANOREXIA. Fourth, we use
the probability assessments associated with the similarity network in conjunction with the noisy-OR-gate
model (Equation 7) to compute the probability distributions for each manifestation. Finally, we assert
that APPI and RUPTURED ECTOPIC are marginally
independent, and assess the prior probabilities for
these variables.
In transforming the similarity network to a
multiple-disease belief network, we added several assertions of conditional independence. In particular,
the similarity network implies only that the manifestations are conditionally independent given NORMAL, APPI alone, and RUPTURED ECTOPIC alone.
The multiple-disease belief network, however, also
encodes the assertion that the manifestations are
independent given that both APPI and RUPTURED
ECTOPIC are present in a patient. In general, when
we apply the transformation described in the previous paragraph, we must verify that these additional
assertions are valid.
Also, in transforming the similarity network to a
multiple-disease belief network, we used the fact that
NORMAL was connected to each of the remaining diseases in the similarity graph. That is, we used the
fact that the similarity graph had a star topology,
with NORMAL as its center. To understand this observation, let us consider the similarity network in
Figure 8(b). Here, APPI and NORMAL are not connected, and thus we cannot identify those manifestations that are influenced by the chance node APPI
in the multiple-disease belief network. Of course,
we could add an arc from APPI to every manifestation in the multiple-disease belief network, but, in so
doing, we would loose the assertions of conditional
independence implied by the absence of the arc from
APPI to ANOREXIA.
Although the transformation is facilitated by a
similarity graph with a star topology, we should not
require an expert to compose such graphs. Indeed,
an expert might not be able to compose a local belief network for discriminating a particular disease
from NORMAL. Fortunately, however, we can transform any similarity network to one whose similarity
graph has a star topology. Specifically, given any
similarity network, we first construct and assess the
global belief network associated with that similarity
network. Then, for each fault in the similarity graph
(other than NORMAL), we construct a local belief
network for discriminating that fault with NORMAL,
using the probability distributions from the global
belief network, and any ordering over the nondistinguished variables that is consistent with the global

belief network (see [5, Chapter 3]). Once we obtain this new similarity network, we can construct
the multiple-fault belief network from that similarity network as described previously.

General Algorithm

Let us now consider a general algorithm for transforming a similarity network S into a multiple-fault
belief network M. Let f0 , f1 , f2 , . . . , fn denote the
instances of the distinguished variable f in S, where
f0 is NORMAL. In addition, let f i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
denote the binary variable in M that corresponds
to fault fi in S. Also, let x and y denote arbitrary
nondistinguished variables in S. Finally, let S 0 denote a similarity network constructed from S such
that the similarity graph of S 0 has a star topology
with center f0 , and let GS 0 denote the global belief
network constructed from S 0 . We transform S into
M as follows (x −→ y denotes an arc from x to y):
Construct S 0 from S
Construct GS 0 from S 0
For all x in GS 0 , place x in M
For all x −→ y in GS 0 , place x −→ y in M
For fi in S 0 , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, place f i in M
For local belief network f0i in S 0 , i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
For all x in GS 0 , if x is in f0i , then place
hi −→ x in M
For all x,
Determine the probability distributions for x
in M from the distributions for x in
GS 0 , using assertions of causal independence
Assess dependencies among the f i in M
For f i in M, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, assess the
probability distributions for f i
In this transformation, the nondistinguished variables do not need to be binary, provided we generalize beyond the noisy OR-gate model expressed by
Equation 7. In addition, we can generalize this algorithm to include situations where f i is nonbinary,
by representing each instance of f i in the similarity
graph, and by identifying forms of causal independence that can account for the interaction between
f i and each nondistinguished node.
Finally, note that we can use this algorithm to
transform a belief network of the form shown in Figure 1 to a belief network for the diagnosis of multiple faults. As mentioned in the previous section,
we construct S 0 from the global belief network derived from S; we do not construct S 0 from S directly.
Consequently, we do not require an original similarity network S for the transformation.

Summary

The similarity-network representation was designed
for the construction of belief networks for the diagnosis of a single fault. Nonetheless, in this paper,
we have seen that we can also use this representation to facilitate the construction of belief networks
for multiple faults.
