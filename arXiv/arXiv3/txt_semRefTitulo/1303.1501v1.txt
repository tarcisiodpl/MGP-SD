In order to find a causal explanation for data
presented in the form of covariance and con­
centration matrices it is necessary to decide
if the graph formed by such associations is a
projection of a directed acyclic graph (dag).
We show that the general problem of deciding
whether such a dag exists is NP-complete.

INTRODUCTION

The problem addressed in this paper arises in statisti­
cal data analysis. The associations measured by statis­
tical techniques, be they dependencies or correlations,
are inherently symmetric. In contrast, the models with
which analysts choose to explain data consist of asym­
metric associations, often invoking notions of influence
and causation, and normally organized in the form of
a dag (5, 6, 15]. This paper assesses the complexity of
deciding whether a dag explanation exists for an ob­
served set of strong associations, that is, pairwise de­
pendencies that hold when we condition on all other
variables in the system.
There are several technical reasons why analysts pre­
fer dag structures for explanatory purposes (14]. First,
each parameter in the dag has a well understood mean­
ing since it is a conditional probability, i.e., it measures
the probability of a response variable given a partic­
ular configuration of explanatory (parent) variables,
with all other variables unspecified. Second, the task
of estimating the parameters in the dag model is ex­
tremely simple, as it can be decomposed into a se­
quence of local estimation analyses, each involving a
variable and its parent set in the dag. Third, general
results are available for reading all implied indepen­
dencies directly off the dag (4, 6, 11] and for deciding
from the topology of two given dags whether they spec­
ify the same set of independence-restrictions on the
joint distribution (12], and whether one dag specifies
all the restrictions specified by the other (8].
However, the primary reason for the ubiquity of dag
models lies, we believe, with their connection to causal-

ity. Each dag describes a stepwise stochastic process
by which the data could have been generated and in
this way it may "prove the basis for developing causal
explanations" (1]. Causal models, no matter how they
are represented, discovered or tested, are more use­
ful than associational models, because causal model
provide information about the dynamics of the sys­
tem under study, In other words, a joint distribution
tells us how probable events are and how probabili­
ties would change with subsequent observations, but a
causal model also tells us how these probabilities would
change as a result of external interventions in the sys­
tem (7]. Such information is indispensable in most de­
cision making applications, including policy analysis
and treatment management.
It is well known that in order for a dag D to repre­
sent a stable causal model compatible with an observed
distribution P, all the conditional independencies em­
bodied in D must be valid in P [9] . The problem
of deciding whether a given list M of conditional in­
dependencies can be faithfully represented by a dag
was treated in (13] and was shown to require a poly­
nomial (in IMI) number of steps. However, M may
be very large as the total number of conditional inde­
pendencies can in general grow exponentially with the
number of variables. Thus, it is desirable to devise a
test based on more limited information which is readily
available to the analyst. Following Pearl and Wermuth
(10], we assume that for each pair of variables i and
j, we can measure whether i and j are independent
given all other n 2 variables. In the case of normal
variables, such independencies can be readily obtained
from the covariance matrix, as they correspond to the
zero entries in the concentration matrix (the inverse
covariance matrix). When the non-zero entries are
represented as edges in an undirected graph G, the
existence of a dag model of the data entails the exis­
tence of a dag D such that G is the "moral" graph of
D, namely, every pair of nodes sharing a child in D
are adjacent in G (hence the metaphor "moral" (5]). 1

The reason for "marrying" the parent nodes is that
when conditioning on all other variables the parents may
become dependent and are thus indistinguishable from any
other adjacent pair of variables-both give rise to a non-

This paper shows that the problem of deciding the ex­
istence of such a dag is NP-complete. In other words,
there is no way (unless P = NP) to improve the con­
ditions developed in [10) so as to obtain a polynomial
procedure for deciding if a given set of strong depen­
dencies has a causal explanation in a dag. This is,
of course, a worst case result; some of the procedures
discussed in [10) turn out to be effective in practice.

SUFF ICIENT CONDITIONS FOR
MORALITY

Pearl and Wermuth [10] have developed several useful
sufficient conditions ranging from trivial ones to not
so obvious ones.
3.1 Proposition. G is moral if it is chordal.

3.2 Proposition. G is moral if every chordless n­

2.1 Definition. Given a dag D, the moral graph of D

cycle in G, n ;?: 4, has at least one edge that as m

3.3 Proposition. G is moral if its maximal cliques

is the undirected graph obtained by the following two
operations:

2. Remove all orientations (arrowheads).

2.2 Problem. Given an undirected graph G , decide if

it is a moral graph of some dag. If such a dag exists
0
we say that G is moral.
2.3 Lemma. G is moral iff there exists an acyclic ori­

entation of a subset E' of its edges, such that every
unoriented edge connects the tail of two oriented edges
with a common head (two parents of some common
0
child) and no two parents are non-adjacent.

A "web" is a collection of subsets (called components),
at least one of which is exterior, such that when an
exterior component is removed, the resulting structure
is again, either a web or empty [2). The examples
below show that none of these sufficient conditions is
necessary.
3.4 Example. Consider the dag D2 whose moral

graph is G2:

2.4 Example. Consider the graphs GO and G1:

D2

G1 is a moral graph of dag D1:

G2

G2 is a moral graph that is not a web. The cliques
are: abc, acd, bee, cde and de f. Only de f is exterior,
removing de f leaves us with a structure that has no
exterior component, hence G2 is not· a web. Yet G2 is
0
clearly the moral graph of D2.
while GO is not a moral graph of any dag.

NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR
MORAL ITY

Similarly, there are several computationally attractive
necessary conditions [10).

4.2 Proposition. G is moral only if it has an exterior

clique.
4.3 Example. To see that neither condition 4.1 nor

4.2 is sufficient, consider the graph G3:

it is not moral but it satisfies both 4.1 and 4.2.

ANOTHER SUFFIC IENT

The only extreme vertices are e, g, m and o. The
result of removing these in any order is a graph with no
exterior cliques and with the following marked links:
c - f, d - f, k - n, and I- n. If we first remove the
marked edges f - c and f - d, the process will halt
(because the cycle a-b-e-d-a cannot be eliminated.)
However, if we first remove the marked edges 1- n and
k- n, then we will find a good elimination ordering:
0
..., n, h, j, I, k, i, f, ....

The following theorem provides a procedure that prop­
erly discriminates all the examples shown so far, yet it
is not powerful enough to identify some moral graphs.

The proof of NP-completeness exploits the fact that
it is impossible by local means to decide which of the
marked edges should be removed first. While in the
example above it is clear that one should postpone
the removal of f - c and f- d, because it leads to an
impasse (the 4-cycle a-b-c- d-a), such local clues
are not available in the general case.

5.1 Theorem. {10} G can be generated by a dag if all

6

edges of G can be eliminated by repeated application of
the following steps:

6.1 Theorem. Graph morality is NP-complete.

CONDITION

1. An exterior clique C is selected, and an extreme
vertex v is identified within that clique.
2. A marked subgraph G' is induced by removing all
edges that touch v, and marking all edges inC that do
not touch v.
3. Steps 1-2 are repeated on the induced subgraph.

4. If no exterior clique can be found in Step 1, then
0
remove any marked edge and repeat Steps 1-3.
We see that Proposition 3.3 is a special case of Theo­
rem 5.1; if G is a web, none of the marked edges need
be removed.
The following example shows that the elimination
strategy of Theorem 5.1 is not complete, that is, fail­
ure to eliminate all vertices in one ordering does not
imply that no elimination ordering exists.

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

Proof: We first note that the problem is in NP,
because checking whether a graph G = (V, E) is the
moral graph of a dag D = (V, E') over the same set of
vertices takes O(JVI + lEI+ IE'I) time.
To show that the problem is NP-complete, it is enough
to show that 3-SAT is polynomially transformable into
graph morality. Given an expression F in 3-CNF with
n variables and t factors it is possible to construct, in
time polynomial in n + t, a graph G = (V, E) with
32n+ 22t + 8 vertices, such that G is moral if and only
if F is satisfiable.
The remainder of the proof consists of four parts. The
first part describes the construction of the undirected
graph, G, corresponding to the given 3-CNF expres­
sion, F. In the second part, it is assumed that G is the
moral graph of some dag D and some constraints upon
any such dag are derived. In the third part, it is shown
that if G is a moral graph then there exists a satisfying

truth assignment of F. Finally, in the fourth part, it is
shown that if F is satisfiable then G is a moral graph.
6.1.1

Construction

Let Vt, v2, ..., Vn and Ft, F2, ... , Ft be the variables and
factors of F, respectively. Let vf, v{ for 1 $ i $ n and
0 $ j $ 15, F/ for 1 $ i $ t and 0 $ j $ 21, and Si
for 0 $ j $ 7 all be new distinct symbols. Without loss
of generality, assume that every variable appears as a
positive literal and as a negative literal somewhere in
F. That is, for each 1 $ i $ n there exists 1 $ j, j' $
t s.t. v; is a term of factor Fj and v; is a term of
factor Fj' since any expression in 3-CNF without this
property is satisfiable and this property can be tested
in linear time without use of the transformation to
morality. The vertices of G are:

1.
2.
3.

vf and v{ for 1 $ i $ n and 0 $ j $ 15.
Fj for 1 $ i $ t and 0 $ j $ 21.
Si for 0 $ j $ 7.

The edges of G are given by the following:

1. For each 1 $ i $ n, the nodes vf and v{ for 0 $
j $ 15 form a subgraph corresponding to variable
v; as shown in Figure 1.

4. The edges (v?, v?+1) for 1 $ i < n, connect the
subgraphs corresponding to the variables forming
a chain.
5. The edges (S0, v�) and (v�, S5) connect the chain
of subgraphs corresponding to the variables with
the auxiliary subgraph.
6. The edges (S7, Fl1) for 1 $ i $ t connect the
subgraphs corresponding to the factors with the
auxiliary subgraph.
The following three classes of links inter-connect the
subgraphs corresponding to the variables with the sub­
graphs corresponding to the factors forming a clique
for every literal. The size of the clique for any literal is
one more than the number of times that literal appears
in F.

7. (v[S, Ff ) for any 1 $ i $ n, 1 $ j $ t and 0 $
k $ 2 such that term (k + 1) of factor Fj is the
positive literal v;.
8. (v[5, F/ ) for any 1 $ i $ n, 1 $ j $ t and 0 $
k $ 2 such that term ( k + 1) of factor Fj is the
negative literal v;.
9.

(F/, F£) for any 1 $ i, k $ t and 0 $ j, k $ 2 such
that term (j + 1) of factor F; is the same as term
(l + 1) of factor Fk.

6.1.2

Constraints

2. For each 1 $ i $ t, the nodes F/ for 0 $ j $
21 form a subgraph corresponding to factor F; as
shown in Figure 2.

Suppose that there exists a dag D
the moral graph of D is G .

3. The nodes Si for 0 $ j $ 7 form an auxiliary
subgraph as shown in Figure 3.

Since Si for 1 $ i $ 4 form a chordless 4-cycle, it
must be the case that D does not contain at least one

=

(V, E') such that

of these edges. However, the nodes incident upon the
missing edge must have a common neighbor due to
Lemma 2.3. Furthermore those nodes must be ances­
tors of their common neighbor in D. Thus, S1 and
S2 are not adjacent in D, while both S1 -+ S0 and
S2-+ S0 in D.
Similarly, since v{ for 1 :::; i :::; n and 3 :::; j :::; 6 form a
chordless 4-cycle, vf and v[ must not be adjacent in D,
while both vf -+vi 11nd v[ -+ v{ in D. By symmetry
the same result holds for the corresponding nodes v{.
The edge joining S0 and v� must appear in D. Now
since S1 -+ S0 and S1 is not adjacent to v� it must
be the case that S0 -+ vJ in D. This along with the
facts that vf -+ vr and s is not adjacent to vr and vf
is not adjacent to v� imply that there can be no edge
between v� and vr in D, which in turn implies that
both vr -+vi and vr -+vi in D. Now since vr is not
adjacent to vi it follows that vi -+vi.
Again since vi is not adjacent to vr and vf is not
adjacent to vi it follows that there can be no edge
between vi and vr in D, which in turn implies that
both vi -+ vr and vr -+vr in D. Now since vi is not
adjacent to v� it follows that v� -+v�.
These last two paragraphs serve as the base step of an
inductive argument that prove the following about D
for all 1 :::; i :::; n:
1. If i

>

1 then vf-1 -+v? .

2. v? is not adjacent to v[.

3. V9. -+ v�' .
4. v[-+vf.
5. V�. -+ v�-. .
6. vf is not adjacent to vf.

7. vf-+ v?.
8. V-�-+ v-9' .

9. If'

z < n

The inductive part of the proof is virtually identical
except for the replacement of S0 by v?_1, v1 by v;,
and v2 by Vi+l·

Note that v� -+ S5 also follows from the induction.
Since v� is not adjacent to S6 it follows that S 5 -+ S 6 .
Similarly, since S5 is not adjacent to S7 it follows that
S 6 -+ S7. And, finally, since S6 is not adjacent to Fr
for 1 :::; i :::; t it follows that S7 -+ F l1.

Therefore, vf, v{, vf and v{ are ancestors of S7 in D
for all 1 :::; i :::; n. Now consider vf for any 1 :::; i :::; n.
Either vf -+ vf or vf -+ vf. In the latter case vf -+
v? -+ v{. Thus, either way vf is an ancestor of S7•
Similarly, vf is also an ancestor of S7.
Now consider F/ for all 1 :::; i :::; t and 6 :::; j :::; 11. By
Lemma 2 " 3 the edges F.I6 - F.7
F�F.9I and FI.10- Ft-11

cannot appear in D, and these pairs of nodes must be
parents of Fl, Fl and F;5, respectively. Furthermore,
D must also contain Fl -+ FP, Fi4 -+ Fl and Fi5 -+

Fl.

The cliques that inter-connect the subgraphs corre­
sponding to the variables with those corresponding to
the factors (edge construction rules 7-9) all have the
following property: every F node in the clique has a
unique parent in D and none of these parents are ad­
jacent. Furthermore, the only other node in the clique
is either vl5 or vl5 for 1 :::; k :::; n. It follows that the
nodes of the clique in G must form a star in D where
each of the F nodes is a parent of the v or v node, and
the F nodes are not adjacent to each other. In turn,
this implies that v[5 -+ vf4 for all 1 :::; i :::; n and for v.

396

Verma and Pearl

Figure 3: The auxiliary subgraph.
Now, for each 1 $ i $ n either vf � vf or vf � vf in
D. If ii� � vf then analysis of the 4-cycle v[ 0- v[ !­
v[ 4- v} 3- v[ 0 reveals that v[ 5 would be an ancestor
of 87 in D. Similarly, if vf � vf then analysis of the
correspondin� v 4-cycle reveals that v[5 would be an
ancestor of S in D.
The key to the analysis (for vf � vf ) is that v[ 0- v[ !
and v[ 0- v[ 3 can not both appear in D. In the later
case, it is trivial to demonstrate that D would contain
v[ 3 � v[2 � vf and hence v[5 would be is an ancestor
of 87. To conclude the analysis, note that the former
case is impossible since if v[ 0 - v[ 3 does not appear
in D it follows that both nodes must be parents of vf ,
but vf is also a parent of vf and thus G would not be
the moral graph of D as vf is not adjacent to either of
the nodes, v[ 0 or v[ 3, in G.
Next, an analysis similar to the one for the cycle
involving vj , vJ, vJ and vJ will reveal that, for all
1 $ i $ t, Fl2 must be an ancestor of FP in D. Cor­
respondingly, Fl4 is an ancestor of Fl and Fr is an
ancestor of Fl.
Finally, an analysis of the cliques F/8 Fr Fr Fl1, for
all 1 $ i $ t, reveals that, in D, Fl1 must be the
parent of one of the other three nodes (of this clique
in G), because not all three links can be removed in
D, and Fl1 is the child of S1 and S1 is not adjacent to
the other three nodes (of this clique in G). Therefore,
it is easy to show that Fl1 is an ancestor of FP or Fl
or Fl. Note that each of these are ancestors of vJ5 or
vJ5 for some 1 $ j $ n.
At this point, D is almost constrained to contain a
directed cycle. For each 1 $ i $ t and each 1 $ j $ n,
either vJ5 or vJ5 is an ancestor of Fr, and Fll must
be an ancestor of at least one of three (the particular
three are defined by the graph) vJ5 or vJ5 nodes.

6.1.3

Morality implies Satisfiability

If there is a dag D such that G is the moral graph of
D, then the following truth assignment satisfies F: let
Vi=True iff vf � vf.

6.1.4

Satisfiability implies Morality

To get from a satisfying truth assignment to a dag,
first remove and direct the necessary arcs as described
above. Then direct vJ � vJ iff Vj =True. Next, make
Fl1 a parent of any (or allJ of the nodes Fr, Fr, Fl0
which are ancestors of v} or vJ5 nodes that are not
ancestors of Fll, i.e., that correspond to true literals.
The other arc(s) in this clique should be removed in
D.
The remaining arcs can be easily directed without
conflicts. The only interesting part is directing the
links connecting the nodes v{ for 1 $ i $ n and for
7 $ j $ 15 and for v. The direction of these arcs de­
pends upon the direction of the arc between vf and vf
0
and can be seen in the following example.
