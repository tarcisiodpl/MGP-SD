Motivation: Approaches for testing sets of variants, such as a set of
rare or common variants within a gene or pathway, for association
with complex traits are important. In particular, set tests allow for
aggregation of weak signal within a set, can capture interplay among
variants, and reduce the burden of multiple hypothesis testing. Until
now, these approaches did not address confounding by family relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming more
important as larger data sets are used to increase power.
Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles
confounders. Our model is based on the linear mixed model and
uses two random effects—one to capture the set association signal
and one to capture confounders. We also introduce a computational
speedup for two-random-effects models that makes this approach
feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with both
the likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields
more power while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richly structured GAW14 data demonstrates that our
method successfully corrects for population structure and family
relatedness, while application of our method to a 15,000 individual
Crohn’s disease case-control cohort demonstrates that it additionally
recovers genes not recoverable by univariate analysis.

association between rare variants within a gene and disease (Wu et
al., 2011; Bansal et al., 2010). As next generation sequencing rapidly becomes the norm, these set-based tests, complementary to
single SNP tests, will become increasingly important. However,
existing methods for testing sets of SNPs do not handle confounding such as arises when related individuals or those of diverse ethnic backgrounds are included in the study. Such confounders,
when not accounted for, result in loss of power and spurious associations (Balding, 2006; A. Price et al., 2010). Yet it is precisely
these richly structured cohorts which yield the most power for
discovery of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits. Moreover, such structure typically presents itself as data cohorts become
larger and larger to enable the discovery of weak signals.

Several approaches have been used to jointly test sets of SNPs:
post hoc, gene-set enrichment in which univariate P values are
aggregated (Holden et al, 2008), operator-based aggregation such
as “collapsing” of SNP values (Braun and Buetow, 2011; B. Li and
Leal, 2008), multivariate regression, typically penalized
(Schwender et al., 2011; Malo et al., 2008), and variance component (also called kernel) models such as a linear mixed models
(Wu et al., 2011, 2010; Quon et al., 2013).

INTRODUCTION

Traditional Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) test one
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a time for association
with disease, overlooking interplay between SNPs within a gene or
pathway, missing weak signal that aggregates in sets of related
SNPs, and incurring a severe penalty for multiple testing. More
recently, sets of SNPs have been tested jointly in a gene-set enrichment style approach (Holden et al, 2008), and also in seeking

whom correspondence should be addressed, equal contributions.

In this paper, we introduce a new, powerful and computationally
efficient likelihood ratio-based set test that accounts for rich confounding structure. We demonstrate control of type I error as well
as improved power over the more traditionally used score test.
Finally, we demonstrate application of our approach to two real
GWAS data sets. Both data sets showed evidence of spurious association due to confounders in an uncorrected analysis, while application of our set test corrected for confounders and uncovered
signal not recovered by univariate analysis. Finally, our test is
extremely computationally efficient owing to development of a
new linear mixed model algorithm also presented herein, which
makes possible, for example, set analysis of the 15,000 individual
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data.

Our approach is based on the linear mixed model (LMM) which
can equivalently be viewed as a multivariate regression. In particular, use of a LMM with a specific form of genetic similarity matrix is equivalent to regressing those SNPs used to estimate genetic
similarity on the phenotype (Hayes et al., 2009; Listgarten et al.,
1

J.Listgarten et al.

2012). If one uses only SNPs to be tested in the similarity matrix as
in Wu et al., 2010, 2011, then one is effectively performing a multivariate regression test. However, by also using SNPs that tag
confounders in a separate similarity matrix, our model can additionally correct for confounders, as has been done in a single-SNP
test GWAS setting (Kang et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006; Listgarten
et al., 2012; Lippert et al., 2011). Finally, our approach allows one
to condition on other causal SNPs, by way of the similarity matrix,
for increased power, again, as has been done in single-SNP test
setting (Atwell et al., 2010; Listgarten et al., 2012; Segura et al.,
2012).
The use of LMMs to correct for confounders in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is now widely accepted, because this
approach has been shown capable of correcting for several forms
of genetic relatedness such as population structure and family relatedness (Kang et al., 2010; Astle and Balding, 2009; Yu et al.,
2006; A. Price et al., 2010). Independently, the use of LMMs to
jointly test rare variants has become prevalent (Wu et al., 2010,
2011). In our new approach, we marry the aforementioned uses of
LMMs to perform set tests in the presence of confounders within a
single, robust, and well-defined statistical model.
Because of the aforementioned equivalence, our approach can also
be viewed as a form of linear regression with two distinct sets of
covariates. The first set of covariates consists of SNPs that correct
for confounders (and other causal SNPs), that is, those which predict race and relatedness, for example. Inclusion of these SNP
covariates makes the data for individuals independently and identically distributed (i.e., knowing the value of these SNPs induces a
common distribution from which the individuals are drawn). The
second set of covariates consists of SNPs for a given set of interest,
such as those SNPs belonging to a gene. We call our approach
FaST-LMM-Set.
Computing the likelihood for our model—a LMM with two random effects—is, naively, extremely expensive, as it scales cubically with the number of individuals (e.g., Listgarten et al, 2010). For
example, on the 15,000 individual WTCCC data set we analyse,
currently available algorithms would need to compute and store in
memory genetic similarity matrices of dimension 15,000 × 15,000
and repeatedly perform cubic operations on them to test just a single set of SNPs—a practically infeasible approach. However, extending our previous work that made LMMs with a single random
effect linear in the number of individuals (Lippert et al 2011) to the
two-variance component model needed here, we bypass this computational bottleneck, yielding a new, two-random-effects algorithm which is linear in the number of individuals. This advance
enables us to analyse data sets which could not otherwise be practically analysed, such as the 15,000 individual WTCCC cohort
(The Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007). As a case in point,
using the naïve cubic approach to test the gene set IL23R (containing 14 SNPs) took 13 hours as compared to one minute for our
new approach (all on a single processor), demonstrating a speedup
factor of 780 (and significantly less memory usage because the
genetic similarity matrix need never be computed with our approach).

METHODS

Let 𝑁(𝒗|𝒖; 𝚺) denote a multivariate Normal distribution in 𝒗 with mean 𝒖
and covariance matrix 𝚺. The log likelihood of a one-variance-component
linear mixed model in the linear regression view is given by
LL ≡ log ∫ N (𝒚|𝑿𝜷 +

𝟏
√𝒔

𝑽𝒘; 𝜎𝑒2 𝑰) ⋅ N(𝒘|𝟎; 𝜎𝑔2 𝑰) d𝒘,

where 𝒚 is a 1 × 𝑁 vector of phenotype values for 𝑁 individuals; 𝜷 is the
set of the fixed effects of the covariates stored in the design matrix 𝑿; 𝑰 is
an 𝑁 × 𝑁 identity matrix; 𝜎𝑒2 is the residual variance in the regression; 𝒘
are the 1 × 𝑁 random effects for the SNPs stored in the design matrix V
(dimension 𝑁 × 𝑠), and N(𝒘|0; 𝜎𝑔2 𝑰) is the distribution for the weight
parameters. That is, the random regression weights, 𝒘 are marginalized
over independent Normal distributions with equal variance 𝜎𝑔2 .
Equivalently, and more typically, the log likelihood is written with random
effects marginalized out,
LL = log N(𝒚|𝑿𝜷; 𝜎𝑒2 𝑰 + 𝜎𝑔2 𝑲),
where the genetic similarity (called the kernel in some contexts), 𝑲, is
𝟏
given by 𝑲= 𝑽𝑽𝑻 , as is the case, for example, when 𝑲 is the realized
𝒔
relationship matrix (RRM) (B. J. Hayes et al, 2009; Lippert et al, 2011).
Given this equivalence, the SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity (those
in 𝑽) can be interpreted as a set of covariates in the regression.
In our model, we partition the random effects into two sets: one set of random effects, 𝒘𝑪 (with design matrix 𝑽𝑪 ), are used to correct for confounders (and condition on causal SNPs) using 𝑠𝑐 SNPs, while the other set, 𝒘𝑺,
are used to test the 𝑠𝑠 SNPs of interest in the corresponding design matrix,
𝑽𝑺 . The log likelihood (in the linear regression view) is then written
LL = log ∬ N (𝒚|𝑿𝜷 +

𝑽𝑪
√𝒔𝒄

𝒘𝑪 +

𝑽𝑺
√𝒔𝒔

𝒘𝑺 ; 𝜎𝑒2 𝑰) ⋅ N(𝒘𝑪 |0; 𝑰) N(𝒘𝑺 |0; 𝑰) d𝒘𝑪d𝒘𝑺 ,

where each set of random effects has a separate variance (𝜎𝐶2 and 𝜎𝑆2 ). Again,
we can equivalently write this in the marginalized form,
𝐿𝐿 = log N (𝒚|𝑿𝜷; 𝜎𝑒2 𝑰 +

𝜎𝐶2
𝜎𝑆2
𝑽𝑪 𝑽𝑻𝑪 + 𝑽𝑺 𝑽𝑺 T ) .
𝑠𝑐
𝑠𝑠

For convenience, we re-parameterize this as
𝐿𝐿 = log N(𝒚|𝑿𝜷; 𝜎𝑒2 𝑰 + 𝜎𝑔2 [(1 − 𝜏)𝑲𝑪 + 𝜏𝑲𝑺 ]),

(1)

where now the covariance matrix, 𝑲, has been partitioned into two variance
components:
𝑲 ≡ (1 − 𝜏)𝑲𝑪 + 𝜏𝑲𝑺 ,

ers, and 𝑲𝑺 ≡

𝑽𝑪 𝑽𝑻𝑪 (𝑽𝑪 is of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑠𝑐 ) to account for confound𝟏
𝒔𝒔

𝑽𝑺 𝑽𝑻𝑺 (𝑽𝑺 is of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑠𝑆 ) to model signal from a

pre-defined set of SNPs of interest, such as those within a gene. The scalar
parameter 𝜏 ∈ [0,1] is estimated from the data by, for example, restricted
maximum likelihood (REML). The null model for our set test is given by
𝜏 = 0, while the alternative model allows 1≥τ≥0.
Until lately, estimating the parameters and computing the likelihood of a
LMM was cubic in the number of individuals. However, we have recently
shown that when the number of SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity, 𝑠,
is less than the cohort size, 𝑁, and when genetic similarity matrix, 𝑲, factors as 𝑽𝑽𝑻 (𝑽 of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑠), then the computations (and memory

A powerful and efficient set test for genetic markers that handles confounders

requirement) become linear in 𝑁 (Lippert et al, 2011). So far this result has
been applied in the context of correcting for confounders in a univariate
GWAS with just a single variance component. Originally the 𝑠 SNPs for
inclusion in 𝑽 were obtained by sampling SNPs genome-wide and relying
on linkage disequilibrium (Lippert et al, 2011). However, in light of the
equivalence with linear regression, it became clear that one should choose
the SNPs with feature selection as one would do in any statistical modelling
problem (Listgarten et al., 2012, 2013; Lippert, Quon, et al., 2013). For
example, one can do an uncorrected, univariate scan of the SNPs to select
those which should be used to correct for confounders (and causal SNPs to
condition on), and this is precisely the approach we take here, just as in
(Listgarten et al., 2012; Lippert, Quon, et al., 2013).
Thus, in our approach, we select 𝑠𝑐 SNPs for 𝑲𝑪 by first sorting all available SNPs according to their univariate linear-regression P values (in increasing order), and then evaluate the use of more and more SNPs in order
until we find an optimal number of SNPs (Listgarten et al., 2012). This
resulted in 650 and 310 SNPs for the GAW14 and Crohn’s analyses, respectively. Additionally, any SNPs that were being tested (i.e., those in 𝑽𝑺 ),
and those within 2 centimorgans, were removed from 𝑽𝑪 so as not to contaminate the null model (Listgarten, Lippert, C. M. Kadie et al, 2012). This
type of approach for correction of confounders in univariate tests has previously been demonstrated to work well on a broad range of data sets
(Listgarten, Lippert, C. M. Kadie et al, 2012; Listgarten, Lippert, and
Heckerman, 2012). However, we note that on some other data sets, we
found that our original approach (Listgarten et al., 2012) could be suboptimal; therefore, we have now moved to a slightly different approach
(Lippert, Quon, et al., 2013).
For estimation of variance parameters and computation of the likelihood
ratio test statistic, we use REML, which is itself a valid likelihood for the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) and can be computed in the same time and
memory complexity as the (unrestricted) likelihood. Details on efficient
parameter estimation are provided in (Lippert et al., 2011).
When testing sets in an uncorrected manner, that is, without accounting for
confounders (which we did for comparison purposes), we omitted the portion of the variance which corrected for confounders, 𝑲𝐶 . In particular, we
set 𝜏 = 1, and tested the significance of 𝜎𝑔2 with the same LRT described
next.
P Value Computation
We have now fully specified our model for doing set tests when confounders are present. To obtain a P value on the set of SNPs of interest, such as
those belonging to a gene (i.e., those in 𝑽𝑺 ), we use an LRT. In particular,
to test the significance of the set of SNPs of interest, we compare the maximum restricted likelihood of the data with and without the set of SNPs of
interest, that is, the maximum restricted likelihood of the alternative and
null models. More formally, our null hypothesis is given by 𝐻0 : τ=0, while
our alternative hypothesis is given by 𝐻𝑎 : 1 ≥ 𝜏 ≥ 0.
To obtain calibrated P values, we require an accurate estimate of the distribution of statistics under the null hypothesis. However, obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimate of this distribution is not straight-forward. Standard software uses a parametric form for this distribution of 0.5𝜒𝑜2 ∶ 0.5𝜒12—
a 50-50 mixture of two 𝜒 2 distributions, the first with zero degrees of freedom, and the other with one degree of freedom. The former accounts for
the fact that the tested parameter is on the boundary of the allowed space in
the null model (Self and Liang, 1987; Dominicus et al., 2006)—that is, to
account for the fact that 𝜏 = 0 in the null model, and 1 ≥ 𝜏 ≥ 0 in the
alternative. The necessary regularity conditions for this null distribution to
hold, include that the outcome variable can be partitioned into a large number of identically and independently distributed sub-vectors (Greven et al.,
2008)—conditions which are not generally met in our setting because individuals may be arbitrarily related to one another. It has been shown that
when the regularity conditions are not met, the 0.5𝜒𝑜2 ∶ 0.5𝜒12 distribution
yields conservative P values (Greven et al., 2008) because the mixing

weight on the 𝜒𝑜2 component is too low at fifty percent. We have also found
this to be the case in our setting (Table 1).
Although one might consider use of a parametric bootstrap to estimate the
null distribution, e.g., (Greven et al., 2008), such an approach dramatically
increases the running time over computation of the test statistics themselves
because of the extremely large number of bootstrap test statistics needed.
Yet another alternative is to use an empirical distribution based on permutations, which faces a similar problem. However, one can use many fewer
permutations by instead assuming a parametric form of the null distribution
and then fitting the few required parameters to the test statistics generated
from the permutations (Lee, Emond, et al., 2012). It is such an approach
that we take here. Note that this approach assumes that the null distribution
of test statistics is the same across all tests, an assumption that has also
been made in the small sample correction in SKAT-O and elsewhere (Lee,
Emond, et al., 2012; Greven et al., 2008; Greven, 2007).
The parametric form of the null distribution that we assume, and to which
we fit null distribution test statistics to, is inspired by (Greven, 2007;
Greven et al., 2008), who reported that a mixture of 𝜒𝑜2 and 𝑎𝜒12 , where 𝑎 is
the scaling parameter for the scaled chi-square distribution, yielded good
type I control when testing a variance component in a single-component
LMM. We use the same parametric form of the null distribution, except, to
gain additional flexibility for the two-component LMM, we allow the degrees of freedom on the second component, 𝑑, to be different from 1 (finding this to be useful in the sense that we estimate 𝑑 ≠ 1). That is, we use
the null distribution, 𝜋𝜒𝑜2 : (1 − 𝜋)𝑎𝜒𝑑2 with free parameters 𝜋, 𝑎, and 𝑑.
Using this distributional form, we found that a fit of the free parameters to
the (full collection of test) statistics yielded P values that were too liberal in
the tail (Table 1). Thus, we instead fit our parametric parameters using only
the most significant tail of the null distribution of test statistics—in particular the top 10% of null test statistics. (Note that in our experiments with just
a single variance component, P values were also liberal in the tail—those
for which p<<0.05. This regime was not examined by Greven et al.).
We now describe the details of our approach for estimating the free parameters, 𝜋, 𝑎, and 𝑑, of this null distribution. To generate a single null test
statistic for a set, we permuted the individuals for only the SNPs in that set.
Because we do not permute the SNPs (rather, the individuals), the pattern
of linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs within a single test remains
intact. Although we permute the individuals, who are not (generally) identically and independently distributed, we do so only for the SNPs in the test
set, leaving any confounding signal among the covariates, the confounding
SNPs and the phenotype intact. We found that null distribution parameter
estimates stabilized with the use of 10 permutations per test (for both
WTCCC and GAW14). Thus, our procedure has a runtime roughly a factor
of ten larger than if we had not needed permutations. Within a gene, we use
the same permutation for all SNPs, and we used the same 10 permutations
across all sets.
Given this permutation-generated sample of test statistics from the null
distribution, we fit the parameters a, and d as follows. The 𝜒𝑜2 distribution is a Dirac delta function at 0—that is, this component of the null distribution yields only test statistics of 0, and correspondingly p=1. Further2
more, the 𝜒𝑑>0
yields a test statistic of 0 with measure zero. Consequently,
one can obtain good estimates of the parameters simply by assuming that
precisely those tests with variance parameter estimate 𝜏 = 0 belong to the
𝜒𝑜2 component, and then estimating 𝜋 as the proportion of tests belonging to
this component. We then estimate 𝑎 and 𝑑 directly from the non-zero test
statistics (those likely to belong to the 𝑎𝜒𝑑2 component) using a regression
in which these parameters are adjusted such that resulting LRT P values
have the least squared error with the theoretical P values (derived conditionally on an estimate of π). Specifically, we use the log P value squared
error, and only use the smallest 10% of P values in the regression. This
truncated regression approach consistently yielded calibrated quantilequantile plots (Figure 1) and also controlled type I error (Table 1). Furthermore, it yielded better power than the score test (Table 2).

J.Listgarten et al.

In summary, our overall approach is as follows: (1) for each set to be tested, permute the individuals of the SNPs belonging to this set, all in the
same manner; (2) compute the restricted LRT statistic for this permuted
data to obtain a test statistic from the null distribution; (3) repeat step 1 ten
times; (4) estimate the proportion of test statistics drawn from the 𝜒𝑜2 component, 𝜋̂, as the proportion of tests in which the parameter τ=0; (5) use the
largest 10% of test statistics to perform a regression to fit the 𝑎𝜒12 component —that is find 𝑎̂ and 𝑑̂ which minimize the squared error of the log10 𝑃
values with their theoretical values (uniform distribution on [𝜋̂, 1]); (6)
compute the test statistic for all sets (non-permuted data) and then compute
the corresponding P values for these using the null distribution 𝜋̂𝜒𝑜2 : (1 −
𝜋̂)𝑎̂𝜒𝑑2̂ .
In application to real data (described next), our procedure yielded 𝜋 =
0.641, 𝑎 = 2.29, 𝑑 =0.961, on the GAW14 data, and 𝜋 = 0.643, 𝑎 =
1.41, 𝑑 = 0.85 on the WTCCC data.
Data Sets and Other Methods
The first data set was obtained from the Genetic Analysis Workshop
(GAW) 14 (Edenberg et al., 2005). It consisted of autosomal SNP data
from an Affymetrix SNP panel and a phenotype indicating whether an
individual smoked a pack of cigarettes a day or more for six months or
more. The cohort included over eight ethnicities and numerous close family
members—1,034 individuals in the dataset had parents, children, or siblings also in the dataset. In addition to the curation provided by GAW, we
excluded a SNP when either (1) its minor allele frequency was less than
0.05, (2) its values were missing in more than 10% of the population, or (3)
its allele frequencies were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (𝑝 < 0.001).
In addition, we excluded an individual when more than 10% of SNP values
were missing. After filtering, there were 7,579 SNPs across 1,261 individuals.
The second data set comprised the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) 1 data and consisted of SNP and phenotype data for seven
common diseases: bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-I diabetes, and type-II
diabetes (The Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007). Each phenotype set
contained about 1,900 individuals. In addition, the data included a set of
approximately 1,500 controls from the UK Blood Service Control Group
(NBS). The data did not include a second control group from the 1958
British Birth Cohort (58C), as restrictions on it precluded use by a commercial organization. Our analysis for the Crohn’s phenotype used data
from the NBS group and the remaining six phenotypes as controls (Lippert,
Listgarten, et al., 2013). We filtered SNPs as described by the WTCCC
(Laaksovirta et al., 2010), and additionally excluded a SNP if either its
minor-allele frequency was less than 1%, it was missing in greater than 1%
of individuals, or its genetic distance was unknown. After filtering, 356,441
SNPs remained. Unlike the approach used by the WTCCC, we included
non-white individuals and close family members to increase the potential
for confounding and thereby better exercise the LMM. In total, there were
14,925 individuals across the seven phenotypes and control, as in our previous work (Listgarten et al., 2012; Lippert et al., 2011; Lippert, Listgarten,
et al., 2013). We concentrated our evaluations on Crohn’s disease, as inflation for this phenotype was greatest with an uncorrected univariate analysis.
For the WTCCC data, we grouped SNPs into gene sets using gene positions
provided on the USCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Kent
et al., 2002; Dreszer et al., 2012) using build hg19 (we also converted the
original WTCCC annotations to this build), which yielded 13,850 gene
sets. Because the GAW14 SNPs mapped to only 251 non-singleton gene
sets with this strategy, we instead formed sets for this data set by using
overlapping 1 centimorgan windows, yielding 2,157 sets. For WTCCC, the
set sizes ranged from 1 to 748, with a mean value of 11, and a standard
deviation of 24. For the GAW14 data, the set sizes ranged from 2 to 38,
with a mean value of 5, and a standard deviation of 4. More generally, this
approach of forming sets from windows of nearby SNPs along the genome
could be used to map an entire genome into sets, even when the SNPs do

4

not lie in genes. However, it is not our goal here to evaluate different ways
in which one might group SNPs, but instead to demonstrate that we can test
sets of SNPs in the presence of confounders.
All analyses assumed additive effects of a SNP on phenotype, using a 0/1/2
encoding for each SNP (indicating the number of minor alleles for an individual). Missing SNP data was mean imputed. Multiple testing was accounted for with a Bonferroni correction.
In counting hits for Crohn’s disease (Table 4), we omitted any genes found
in the MHC region because this region is complicated by very long-range
linkage disequilibrium. We used positions 29-34 Mb on chromosome 6 as
the boundaries of the MHC, as suggested by the MHC sequencing consortium (Pereyra et al., 2010).
Experimental Setup to Assess Control of Type I Error and Power
We used synthetic data based on the real WTCCC data to assess the quality
of our new method, as well as to compare it against a score test. In particular, to assess type I error, we used all SNPs from the WTCCC data set, and
then permuted the individuals for SNPs in each set tested so as to create
null-only test statistics. We permuted the data in this way a total of 72
times, yielding 997,200 null test statistics (because 13,850 sets were tested
for each data set). We additionally permuted another 10 data sets in order to
estimate the parameters of the null distribution (𝜋, 𝑎, 𝑑) as prescribed by
our approach.
For assessment of power, we again used all SNPs from the WTCCC data
set, and then generated synthetic phenotypes using a linear mixed model.
To do so, we first we fit the null model to the real data to obtain estimates
of the parameters 𝜎𝑒2 and 𝜎𝑔2 . Then we used the model 𝑝(𝒚) =
N(𝒚|𝟎; 𝜎𝑐2 𝑲𝑪 + 𝜎𝑠2 𝑲𝑺 ]), with confounding variance 𝜎𝑐2 equal to estimated
environmental noise, 𝜎𝑒2 = 0.094, and genetic variance, 𝜎𝑠2 , equal to the
estimated genetic variance 𝜎𝑔2 = 0.0125. Furthermore, we used the same
310 confounding SNPs for 𝑲𝑪 as used on the real data, while using all
321,839 SNPs further than 2 centimorgans away from those in 𝑲𝑪 as the
causal SNPs for 𝑲𝑺 (those contained in the true positive sets in our power
experiments). We generated five phenotypes in this way. The resulting
phenotypes behaved much like the real data in that, on average, we found
10 Bonferroni-corrected sets on each of five data sets, as compared to the
23 found on the real data (note that Table 4 does not include SNPs from the
MHC region and therefore shows only 16). For both type I error and power
experiments, we tested the same gene sets as on the real data, except for
power we did not include any gene sets containing SNPs in the 𝑽𝑪 (those
SNPs used to correct for confounding) or within 2 centimorgans of these
SNPs, to be sure that the sets were unambiguously true positives.
When comparing our LRT approach against a score-based test, we used the
same score test as SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) which uses the Davies method
to compute P values from the null distribution (but here with our FaSTLMM-Set model). This score test has previously been shown to control
type I error (Lee, Emond, et al., 2012), consistent with our own findings
(not shown).
Linear-Time Computations
What remains left to explain is how to achieve the linear-time speedup in
the present setting—the case of two random effects. The crux of the cubic
to linear-time speedup in the single random effect model was to bypass
construction of 𝑲 and the required spectral decomposition of 𝑲 by recognizing that one can instead use 𝑽 and the spectral decomposition of 𝑽
(Lippert et al., 2011). Note that we can view the two-random-effects model
as a single random effect with covariance 𝑲 ≡ (1 − 𝜏)𝑲𝑪 + 𝜏𝑲𝑺 . To use
the algebraic speed-up just mentioned, we observed that 𝑲 = 𝑽𝑽𝑻 , where

examined here (and almost all others we have analyzed), we obtained the
linear-time computations and memory footprint just as in Lippert et al.
(2011). (One might also consider using low rank update equations of the
type used in Listgarten et al. (2012) to perform exclusion, although we
have not yet implemented this.) Finally, to perform parameter estimation in
this two-random-effects model, we used an approach similar to that reported in Lippert et al. (2011). That is, we used a one-dimensional Brent search
optimization routine to find the value of 𝜏 which maximized the restricted
likelihood. For each call to the restricted likelihood for a particular value of
𝜏, efficient computations were performed as in (Lippert et al., 2011), except
using the two random effects.

RESULTS

Type I Error and Power on Synthetic Data
First we examined whether our LRT approach controlled type I
error. As described in Methods, we generated null-only test statistics by way of permutations on the WTCCC data, obtaining a total
of roughly 1 million test statistics. The type I error was controlled
(Table 1). Note that neither (1) fitting the null distribution parameters (to all test statistics) by way of maximum likelihood, nor (2)
use of a 0.5𝜒𝑜2 ∶ 0.5𝜒12 null distribution, yielded calibrated P values. The first was liberal, while the latter was conservative (Table
1). Finally, quantile-quantile plots in Figure 1 additionally demonstrates good calibration over the entire range of P values from our
method, for the same points as in Table 1. Because the score test
we used has already been shown to control type I error (Lee,
Emond, et al., 2012), we do not report on it here, but note that we
did find the same in our own experiments (not shown).

around the solid red diagonal. Points shown are for null-only data (generated by permuting individuals in the SNPs to be tested—see Methods) and
only for the non-unity P values (those assumed to belong to the non-zero
degree of freedom component of the null distribution). The portion of the
expected distribution of P values shown is uniform on the interval [𝜋̂,1],
where 𝜋̂ is the estimated mixing weight in the null distribution.

Number of tests with P values less than α. The last column shows the results of a
binomial test comparing the number of tests found by LRT as compared to the score
test. The first row denotes the Bonferroni threshold for the WTCCC data set.

Application to Real Data
The first row shows results for our LRT-based method; the second row (“nontruncated ML”) shows results when fitting the null distribution parameters using
maximum likelihood with all test statistics; the third row shows results using a 0.5𝜒𝑜2 ∶
0.5𝜒12 null distribution. Results significantly different from expected according to the
binomial test (p<0.05) are denoted with a *.

Next we compared the power of our LRT approach to a score test
approach (both using the same two random effects model) on synthetic data (see Methods). Over five synthetic data sets and a range
of significance levels, LRT found significantly more sets than the
score test (Table 2). Furthermore, on the real WTCCC data, LRT
again found significantly more sets (Table 4).

We investigated our new approach on two data sets. The first was
the Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 14, which included data
from over eight ethnicities and numerous close family members for
a total of 1,261 individuals. After filtering there were 7,579 SNPs
available for analysis. The second data set was from the WTCCC
from which we used 14,925 individuals and 356,441 SNPs in our
analysis. We used the Crohn’s phenotypes because this was the
one showing the most confounding in an uncorrected analysis.
Unlike the WTCCC (The Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007), we
included non-white data for individuals and close family members
to increase power and because the LMM can treat them properly
(Kang et al., 2010; Astle and Balding, 2009; A. Price et al., 2010).

To judge the degree of confounding due to genetic relatedness, and
to ensure that our LMM approach could sufficiently correct for
confounding, we ran both an uncorrected and corrected univariate
analysis on each data set, because this is a well-understood test that
has been reported on before. Here, the extent of test statistic inflation due to unmodelled confounders was assessed using the λ statistic, also known as the inflation factor from genomic control
(Devlin and Roeder, 1999). The value λ is defined as the ratio of
the median observed to median theoretical test statistic. Values of λ
substantially greater than (less than) 1.0 are indicative of inflation
(deflation). As can be seen in Table 3, without correction, the test
statistics appear to be inflated. Although one might consider 𝜆𝐺𝐶 =
1.08 (seen on the corrected analysis of WTCCC) as still moderately inflated, it has been shown that complex, highly polygenic traits
lead to increases in 𝜆𝐺𝐶 (Yang et al., 2011) in the absence of spurious signal. Moreover, the WTCCC themselves reported 𝜆𝐺𝐶 in the
range of 1.08-1.11 upon removal of individuals from different
races and related individuals (neither of which we removed), and
also upon adjustment with two principal components, suggesting
that a 𝜆𝐺𝐶 of 1.08 is the result of polygenic influence (The
Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007).

In the course of our analyses we noticed that some sets with small
P values had almost no univariate signal in any of the SNPs. In
particular, among the 16 sets in the WTCCC data supported by
either meta-analysis or literature search, six (C1orf141, SAG,
SLC24A4, SLC22A4, TCTA, and PTPN2) were missed by the
univariate analysis (i.e., a SNP lying within 50 kilobases of any of
the regions reported by Frank et al. was not found to be significant). One of the motivations for doing set analysis is to uncover
signals for such regions. The intuition here is the same as in a univariate conditional GWAS analysis. That is, conditioning on variables can lead to an increase in power, revealing signal that would
be hidden without the conditioning (Atwell et al., 2010; Segura et
al., 2012). Thus the set test acts not only to aggregate weak signal,
but also to unmask signal hidden by covariates included by virtue
of doing a set test. We investigated one such case in detail. In particular, we computed the univariate P values for each of the 15
SNPs associated with the gene SLC22A4, marginally, as well as
conditioned on all the other SNPs in this gene, using a LMM to
correct for confounding. This gene was found to be associated with
Crohn’s disease using FaST-LMM-Set with 𝑝 = 7.6 × 10−8 . The
smallest marginal univariate P value was 1.2 × 10−5 , but when we
conditioned on the other SNPs in the set, the smallest conditional
univariate P value obtained was 7.0 × 10−8 . This result demonstrates the increased power afforded by the set test owing to the
interplay of SNPs within the gene that is missed by a univariate
approach.

FaST-LMM denotes a one-component (to correct for confounding) linear mixed
model, testing one SNP fixed effect (Listgarten et al., 2012); Uncorrected refers to no
correction for confounding (linear regression).

Having established that both of our data sets required correction
for confounders and that the LMM with our chosen background
genetic similarity matrix, 𝑲𝑆 , sufficiently corrected for confounders, we next applied FaST-LMM-Set, using the same LMMcorrecting component as in the univariate test. The full set of results is available for all analyses in Supplemental Table 1. On
GAW14, the uncorrected set analysis yielded 241 significant sets,
whereas FaST-LMM-Set, which corrects for confounding, yielded
none. It is thought that this data set contains little, if any signal (for
example based on the univariate analysis). On WTCCC Crohn’s
disease, an uncorrected set analysis yielded 26 significant sets,
whereas FaST-LMM-Set yielded 16 (Table 4). Next we investigate
these sets in detail.
To validate the significant sets recovered on the WTCCC Crohn’s
phenotype we used a meta-analysis (Franke et al., 2010; Listgarten
et al., 2012). If a set we found as significant was within 50
kilobases of a validated SNP/region, we counted it as a true positive). Additionally, for the genes not validated by the metaanalysis, we conducted a literature search. Detailed validation results are provided in Supplemental Table 1. Using our newly developed method, FaST-LMM-Set, we found 16 significant gene
sets, of which all but one were validated by the meta-analysis. The
6

remaining gene, SLC24A4, performs a similar function to the validated gene SLC22A4—both are cation transporters
(www.genecards.org (Rebhan et al., 1997)) —suggesting a promising candidate for follow-up.

Significance of Sets is Independent of Set Size
On data with phenotypic association, we expected that there could
be correlation between set size and P value, because with a larger
set, there could be more predictive SNPs and more power. Furthermore, we expected that when confounders were not properly

A powerful and efficient set test for genetic markers that handles confounders

accounted for in the set analysis, that the more SNPs in a set, the
more power the set would have to detect these confounders, and
therefore the stronger the correlation between set size and P value
would appear. The correlations on our real data were consistent
with these expectations. In particular, we saw no significant correlation for FaST-LMM-Set (which corrects for confounders) but
significant correlation when we did not correct for confounders
(Table 5).
We also expected that on null-only data, when confounders were
properly accounted for, the set P value and set size would be independent. Consistent with this expectation, when we permuted the
Crohn’s phenotype to remove signal, the FaST-LMM-Set correlation was reduced to 𝜌 = 0.019 (𝑝 = 0.18).

DISCUSSION

We have developed a novel, efficient approach for testing sets of
genetic markers in the presence of confounding structure such as
arises from ethnic diversity and family relatedness within a cohort.
Application of this algorithm demonstrated that our method corrects for confounders and uncovers signal not recoverable by univariate analysis.
Although we did not analyse rare variant data, we have shown
elsewhere that the underlying LMM methodology works well to
correct for confounding due to rare variants in a univariate setting
(Listgarten et al., 2013). Furthermore, others have already shown
that LMM-based set tests work well for detection of sets of associated rare variants (Wu et al., 2011). It follows that the hybrid approach that we presented here is likely to prove effective in the
setting of testing sets of rare variants in the presence of confounders, although this remains to be investigated fully. For example, we
have found the use of a linear model on a case-control phenotype
to yield inflated tests statistics when testing rare variants.
We have demonstrated that our LRT outperforms a score test for
our model and setting. This is perhaps unsurprising given that the
score test can be viewed as an approximation to the LRT by a second-order Taylor series expansion (Buse, 2007) in the neighbourhood of the null model. Furthermore, given its robust properties,
the LRT is considered the benchmark for statistical testing
(Crainiceanu, 2008). We note, however, that in some recent work
(D.-Y. Lin and Z.-Z. Tang, 2011), when testing for rare variants

using a logistic fixed effects model, a score test was found to perform better than LRT, which was found to be liberal. Although the
best test may depend on context, we note that Lin et al. used a
different model than we did and, in particular, did not use a variance component approach. Also, they used closed-form, asymptotic-based LRT P values rather than making use of empiricallyderived null distributions as we have done here.
For many cases of hidden structure in genetic data, the use of principal component-based covariates is sufficient for correction (A. L.
Price et al., 2006), and thus these covariates could immediately be
added to existing models such as SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) to
achieve a set test that corrects for confounding. However, it is now
widely accepted that there are various forms of confounders which
cannot be corrected for by principal components, but for which a
LMM adequately corrects (Kang et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006; A.
Price et al., 2010), and it is for these problems that we have developed our approach.

We here focused on testing SNPs in a manner similar to SKAT
(Wu et al., 2011). However, it would be straightforward to also
adapt FaST-LMM-Set to the approach of SKAT-O, in which the
original SKAT model is in effect combined with a collapsing-type
approach (Lee, Emond, et al., 2012; Lee, Wu, et al., 2012).
