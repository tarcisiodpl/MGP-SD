qualitative probabilities could substantially
reduce the effort for knowledge engineering and
improve the robustness of results. We examine
experimentally how well infinitesimal
probabilities (the kappa-calculus of Goldszmidt
and Pearl) perform a diagnostic task troubleshooting a car that will not start - by
comparison with a conventional numerical belief
network. We found the infinitesimal scheme to
be as good as the numerical scheme in
identifying the true fault. The performance of
the infinitesimal scheme worsens significantly
for prior fault probabilities greater than 0.03.
These results suggest that infinitesimal
probability methods may be of substantial
practical value for machine diagnosis with small
prior fault probabilities.

1 BACKGROUND AND GOALS

Bayesian and decision theoretic methods have long

been criticized for an excessive need for quantification.
They require many numerical probabilities and

utilities that are difficult to assess and are liable to
judgmental biases. Some people claim that since
human thinking is inherently qualitative, it is
incompatible with quantitative schemes. These
criticisms have fueled interest in alternative
formalisms for reasoning and decision making under
uncertainty that are intended to be easier to use and
more compatible with human cognition. Among these
alternative schemes are: various generalizations of
decision theory [Edwards, 1992]; Dempster-Shafer
belief functions [Shafer, 1976];generalizations of logic,
including default and non-monotonic logics [Ginsberg,
1987]; fuzzy logic [Zadeh, 1983]; possibility theory
[Dubois and Prade, 1988]; and fuzzy probabilities.
If,

however, our goal is simply to provide a qualitative
basis for reasoning and decision making under
uncertainty, there is no need to abandon Bayesian
decision theory. The axioms of decision theory,
indeed, assume only the ability to make qualitative
judgments - that is, to order events by probability or
outcomes by desirability. The quantification of
probabilities and utilities can be based on purely
qualitative judgments. Furthermore, several schemes
have been developed that are purely qualitative, but
are consistent with the axioms of decision theory.
One such scheme is qualitative probabilities, originated
by Wellman [1990; Henrion & Druzdzel 1991;
Wellman & Henrion, 1993]. A second approach to
qualitative probabilities is the kappa-calculus
[Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992], which represents all
probabilities in a Bayesian belief network by e'K, where
is an integral power of E. The K -calculus is

consistent with the axioms of probability where E---+0.
Events are ranked according to K. Events with larger K
are assumed to be negligible relative to events with
smaller K. The calculus provides a plausible set of
events: those with the smallest (most probable)
consistent with the observed findings. The calculus is
sometimes called

qualitative probability.

2 MAPPINGS BETWEEN NUMERICAL

There has been little concerted

effort to demonstrate their application to real tasks and
to evaluate their practicality. Initial studies of QPNs
[Henrion and Druzdzel,

1990; Druzdzel and Henrion,
1993; Druzdzel, 1993] suggest that they are often

inconclusive for nontrivial cases. For example, QPNs
give vacuous results in any case with conflicting
evidence. Studies of qualitative simulation have found

In order to be a b le to apply

the

K -calculus to

probabilistic reasoning on a belief network with finite
probabilities, we need to provide a mapping from
probabilities into kappa values. In order to compare
the results we need to map the kappa results back
again into probabilities. Strictly, the K-calculus is only
valid as E---tO.

We use an approximation for finite

values of E. For a finite E, the K-calculus partitions the

real interval

[0,1] into regions identified by integers,

based on the smallest power of in the polynomial. This
mapping is illustrated in Figure 1.
More specifically, consider the real [0,1] interval I,
which is the interval used by probability theory, and a
discretized representation of I, which we call 5. 5 is a
set of non-negative integers which the -calculus uses to
represent probability measures in the interval I.

We generated a set of 116 test cases, in the following
manner: For each of twelve faults (nine identified
faults plus three leaks), we identified the most likely
(modal) value for each of the ten observable findings.
For each fault, we created a base

findings at their modal value. In four cases, the fault is
itself a finding, which we omitted from the base test

case, since including the true fault as observed in the
test case would be trivial. We then generated a second
case for each fault by omitting the most expensive
observation from the base case.

To obtain results for the numerical probabilistic

scheme, we employed IDEAL [Srinivas and Breese,

1990], using the clustering algorithm from the I DEAL
library. We applied each of the 116 test cases to the
network using each of the six sets of priors,
performing a total of 696 run. For each run we
computed the posterior probability for each of the
twelve faults resulting in 8352 probabilities.

5 RESULTS
Our first goal was to examine the effect of E values on
the performance of the infinitesimal probability
scheme. We then selected the value of E that gave the
best results and examined the effect of varying the

quantity of evidence on the performance of both

numerical and infinitesimal schemes.

We also converted the original numerical probabilities

5.3 The magnitude of priors and the
performance of infinitesimal

probabilities
The infinitesimal probability scheme appears to
perform very well relative to numerical probabilities
for the original car network, in which the prior fault
probabilities are very small, on average 0.00036

To

examine if it performs equally well for larger priors,
we multiplied the prior odds by five odds factors, as
shown in Table

1.

Figure 6 shows the average

probability assigned to the true diagnosis as a function
of the average priors.

Interestingly, the two schemes

are almost indistinguishable up to an average fault
prior 0. 033. Above that, the performance of the
infinitesimal probability drops off sharply - that is,
for average priors of 0.089 and 0.214.
