. For both the Poisson model problem and the Stokes problem in any
dimension, this paper proves that the enriched Crouzeix–Raviart elements are actually identical to the first order Raviart–Thomas elements in the sense that they
produce the same discrete stresses. This result improves the previous result in literature which, for two dimensions, states that the piecewise constant projection of the
stress by the first order Raviart–Thomas element is equal to that by the Crouzeix–
Raviart element. For the eigenvalue problem of Laplace operator, this paper proves
that the error of the enriched Crouzeix–Raviart element is equivalent to that of the
Raviart–Thomas element up to higher order terms.

1. introduction
The aim of this paper is to prove the enriched Crouzeix–Raviart (ECR hereafter)
elements by Hu, Huang and Lin [21] are equivalent to the first order Raviart–Thomas
elements (RT hereafter). The first main result proves that ECR elements are identical
to RT elements for both the Poisson and Stokes problems in any dimension. More
precisely, for the Poisson problem imposed a piecewise constant right–hand function f ,
it is proved that
(1.1)

σRT = ∇NC uECR and uRT = Π0 uECR ,

where uECR and (σRT , uRT ) denote the finite element solutions by the ECR and RT
elements, respectively; while for the Stokes problem imposed a piecewise constant right–
hand function f , it is established that
(1.2)

σRT = ∇NC uECR + pECR id and uRT = Π0 uECR + LuECR ,

where (uECR , pECR ) and (σRT , uRT ) denote the finite element solutions by the ECR and
RT elements, respectively. Herein and throughout this paper, Π0 denotes the piecewise
constant L2 projection with respect to a shape–regular partition T of Ω consisting of
n-simplices, and L is some linear operator. The second main result proves that for the
eigenvalue problem of Laplace operator
(1.3)

k∇NC (u − uECR )k = k∇u − σRT k + h.o.t.

where the constants involved in the high order term depend on the corresponding

eigenvalue. Throughout this paper, kvk denotes (v, v)L2 (Ω) , for any v ∈ L2 (Ω). See the
next two sections for more details of the notations.

hold up to data oscillation. Indeed, it is the first time that the RT elements are proved
in such a direct and simple way to be identical to nonconforming finite elements in any
dimension while the previous results state some relations between the two dimensional
Crouzeix–Raviart (CR hereafter) and RT elements; see below and also [3, 11, 26] for
more details. These results imply that the RT element can not be equivalent to the
CR element in general, which gives a negative answer to an open problem in [15].
The study on the relations between nonconforming finite elements and mixed finite
elements can date back to the pioneer and remarkable work by Arnold and Brezzi in
1985 [3]. In particular, for the two dimensional biharmonic equation, it was proved that
the first order Hellan–Herrmann–Johnson element [19, 20, 25] is identical to the modified Morley element which differs from the usual Morley element [29] only by presence
of the interpolation operator in the right–hand side; while for the two dimensional Poisson problem, it was shown that the L2 projection onto the first order RT element space
of the stress by the CR element, enriched by piecewise cubic bubbles, is identical to the
stress by the RT element. By proposing initially a projection finite element method,
Arbogast and Chen [1] generalized successfully the idea of [3] to most mixed methods of more general second order elliptic problems in both two and three dimensions.
In particular, they showed that most mixed methods can be implemented by solving
projected nonconforming methods with symmetric positive definite stiff matrixes, and
that stresses by mixed methods are L2 projections of those by nonconforming methods.
Let σRT be the discrete stress by the RT element, and uCR be the displacement by the
CR element of the two dimensional Poisson equation. Suppose that f is a piecewise
constant function with respect to T . Marini further explored the relation between the
RT and CR elements of [3] to derive the following relation [26]:
fK
(x − mid(K)) x ∈ K for any K ∈ T ,
2
where fK := f |K denotes the restriction on K of f and mid(K) denotes the centroid of
K. This important identity was exploited by Brenner [8] to design an optimal multigrid
method for the RT element, and by Carstensen and Hoppe to establish, for the first
time, quasi–orthogonality and consequently convergence of both the adaptive RT and
CR elements in [13] and [12], respectively. For the two dimensional Stokes equation, a
similar identity was first accomplished in [11]:

x ∈ K for any K ∈ T . Here (uCR , pCR ) and (σRT , uRT ) are finite element solutions by
the CR and RT elements, respectively, and fK is the restriction on K of the piecewise
constant function f . Given two vectors a ∈ R2 and b ∈ R2 , a ⊗ b := abT defines a 2 × 2
matrix of rank one. See also [24] for a similar relation between the CR and RT elements
for the two dimensional Stokes–like problems. Such a beautiful identity is also used to
prove convergence and optimality of the adaptive pseudostress method in [11].
There is another direction for the study on the relations between nonconforming
finite elements and mixed finite elements, which may start with the remarkable work
by Braess [6]. A recent paper on the two dimensional Poisson model problem due to
Carstensen, Peterseim, and Schedensack [15] states more general and profound comparison results of mixed, nonconforming and conforming finite element methods
(1.7)

k∇u − σRT k ≤ Ck∇NC (u − uCR )k ≈ k∇(u − uC )k,

hold up to data oscillation and up to mesh-size independent generic multiplicative constants, where C is a generic constant independent of the meshsize, and uC is the finite
element solution by the conforming Courant element. See [18, 27] for some relevant
results in this direction. By a numerical counterexample, it was also demonstrated in
[15] that the converse estimate
(1.8)

k∇NC (u − uCR )k ≤ Ck∇u − σRT k

does not hold. In Subsection 3.3, we give an example where the right hand side of the
above inequality vanishes while the left hand side is nonzero, which implies that the
converse of (1.8) is not valid.
This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the Poisson equation, Stokes
equation and their mixed formulations. This section also introduces the ECR and RT
elements. Section 3 proves the equivalence between the ECR and RT elements for the
Poisson equation and Stokes equation respectively. Section 4 proves the equivalence
between the ECR and RT elements for the eigenvalue problem of Laplace operator.
Section 5 shows some numerical results by ECR elements. In the end, the appendix
presents the basis functions and convergence analysis of ECR elements.
2. Poisson equation, stokes equation and nonconforming finite element
methods
We present the Poisson equation, stokes equation and their nonconforming finite
element methods in this section. Throughout this paper, let Ω ⊂ Rn denote a bounded
domain, which, for the sake of simplicity, we suppose to be a polytope.
2.1. The Poisson equation. Given f ∈ L2 (Ω, R), the Poisson model problem finds
u ∈ H01 (Ω, R) such that
(2.1)

(∇u, ∇v) = (f, v)

for all v ∈ H01 (Ω, R).

By introducing an auxiliary variable σ := ∇u, the problem can be formulated as the
following equivalent mixed problem which seeks (σ, u) ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ) × L2 (Ω, R) such

4

that
(2.2)

for any τ ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ),

(σ, τ ) + (u, div τ ) = 0
(div σ, v) = (−f, v)

for any v ∈ L2 (Ω, R).

2.2. The stokes equation. Given f ∈ L2 (Ω, Rn ), the Stokes problem models the motion of incompressible fluids occupying Ω which finds (u, p) ∈ H01 (Ω, Rn ) × L20 (Ω, R) :=
R
{q ∈ L2 (Ω, R), Ω qdx = 0} such that

(2.3)

for any v ∈ H01 (Ω, Rn ) ,

(∇u, ∇v) + (div v, p) = (f , v)

(div u, q) = 0 for any q ∈ L20 (Ω, R).

where u and p are the velocity and pressure of the flow, respectively. Given any n × n
matrix–valued function τ , its divergence div τ is defined as

Let id ∈ Rn×n be the n × n identity matrix. This allows to define the deviatoric part
of τ as
dev τ := τ − 1/n tr(τ ) id .
The definition of the pseudostress σ := ∇u + p id yields the equivalent pseudostress
formulation [4, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24]: Find (σ, u) ∈ Ĥ(div, Ω, Rn×n ) × L2 (Ω, Rn ) such that
(2.4)

(dev σ, dev τ ) + (u, div τ ) = 0

for any τ ∈ Ĥ(div, Ω, Rn×n ) ,

(div σ, v) = −(f , v) for any v ∈ L2 (Ω, Rn ).

2.3. Triangulations. The simplest nonconforming finite elements for both Problem
(2.1) and Problem (2.3) are the CR elements proposed in [16] while the simplest mixed
finite elements for Problem (2.2) and Problem (2.4) are the first order RT element due
to [30] and [4, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24], respectively. Suppose that Ω is covered exactly by
shape–regular partitions T consisting of n-simplices in n dimensions. Let E denote the
set of all n − 1 dimensional subsimplices of T , and E(Ω) denote the set of all the n − 1
dimensional interior subsimplices, and E(∂Ω) denote the set of all the n − 1 dimensional

5

boundary subsimplices. Given E ∈ E, let νE be unit normal vector and [·] be jumps of
piecewise functions over E, namely
[v] := v|K + − v|K −
for piecewise functions v and any two elements K + and K − which share the common
sub-simplice E. Note that [·] becomes traces of functions on E for boundary subsimplices E.
2.4. The enriched Crouzeix–Raviart elements for both the Poisson and Stokes
equations. Given ω ⊂ Ω and an integer m ≥ 0, let Pm (ω) denote the space of polynomials of degree ≤ m over ω. The Crouzeix-Raviart element space VCR over T is defined
as

R
VCR := v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) : v|K ∈ P1 (K) for each K ∈ T , E [v]dE = 0,
R
for all E ∈ E(Ω) , and E vdE = 0 for all E ∈ E(∂Ω) .

To obtain a nonconforming finite element method that is able to produce lower bounds
of eigenvalues of second order elliptic operators, it was proposed in [21] to enrich the
n
P
shape function space P1 (K) by span{ x2i } on each element. This leads to the following

shape function space
(2.5)

i=1

ECR(K) := P1 (K) + span

for any K ∈ T .

The enriched Crouzeix-Raviart element space VECR is then defined by

R
VECR := v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) : v|K ∈ ECR(K)
for
each
K
∈
T
,
E [v]dE = 0,
R
for all E ∈ E(Ω) , and E vdE = 0 for all E ∈ E(∂Ω) .

The enriched Crouzeix–Raviart element method of Problem (2.1) finds uECR ∈ VECR
such that
(2.6)

(∇NC uECR , ∇NC v) = (f, v) for all v ∈ VECR .

In order to construct a stable finite element method for the Stokes problem, we
propose the following finite element space for the pressure
(2.7)

QECR := {q ∈ L20 (Ω, R), q|K ∈ P0 (K) for each K ∈ T }.

The enriched Crouzeix–Raviart element method of Problem (2.3) seeks (uECR , pECR ) ∈
(VECR )n × QECR such that
(2.8)

(∇NC uECR , ∇NC v) + (divNC v, pECR ) = (f , v)

for any v ∈ (VECR )n ,

(divNC uECR , q) = 0 for any q ∈ QECR .

Since VCR ⊂ VECR , the well-posedness of Problem (2.8) follows immediately from that
for the Crouzeix–Raviart element method of Problem (2.3), see [16] for more details.

2.5. The Raviart–Thomas elements for both the Poisson and Stokes equations. For the Poisson equation, one famous mixed finite element is the first order
Raviart–Thomas element whose shape function space is
RT(K) := (P0 (K))n + xP0 (K) for any K ∈ T .
Then the corresponding global finite element space reads
RT(T ) := {τ ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ) : τ |K ∈ RT(K) for any K ∈ T }.

(2.9)

To get a stable pair of space, the piecewise constant space is proposed to approximate
the displacement, namely,
URT := {v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) : v|K ∈ P0 (K) for any K ∈ T }.

(2.10)

The Raviart–Thomas element method of Problem (2.2) seeks (σRT , uRT ) ∈ RT(T )×URT
such that
(σRT , τ ) + (uRT , div τ ) = 0 for any τ ∈ RT(T ),
(2.11)
(div σRT , v) = (−f, v) for any v ∈ URT .

3. Equivalence between the ECR and RT elements
In this section we assume that both f and f are piecewise constant with respect to
T.
3.1. Equivalence between the ECR and RT elements for the Poisson equation. Given any K ∈ T , let Ei , i = 1, 2, · · · , n + 1, be its n − 1 dimensional subsimplices. Let φi , i = 1, 2, · · · , n + 1, and φK be basis functions of the shape function

See the appendix for the specific expressions.

Lemma 3.1. Let uECR be the solution of Problem (2.6). There holds that
∇NC uECR ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ).
Remark 3.2. Since uECR is nonconforming in the sense that uECR 6∈ H 1 (Ω, R), it is
remarkable that ∇NC uECR is H(div) conforming.

7

Proof. Let (σRT , uRT ) the solution of Problem (2.11). Since σRT · νE are a constant
R
and E [v]dE = 0 for any E ∈ E and v ∈ VECR , an integration by parts plus the second
equation of (2.11) yield

σRT · νE vdE − (div σRT , v) = (f, v).

This and (2.6) lead to

Since x·νE is a constant on E, ∇NC uECR ·νE is a constant on E. Since divNC (∇NC uECR −

and the jump [(∇NC uECR − σRT )] · νE are a constant on E, an integration by parts

Hence ∇NC uECR ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ), which completes the proof.

Theorem 3.3. Let uECR and (σRT , uRT ) be the solutions of problems (2.6) and (2.11),
respectively. Then there holds
σRT = ∇NC uECR and uRT = Π0 uECR ,
where Π0 is the piecewise constant L2 projection operator.
Proof. By Lemma 3.1, we only need to prove that (∇NC uECR , Π0 uECR ) is the solution
of Problem (2.11). In fact, given any τ ∈ RT(T ), an integration by parts yields

[uECR ]τ · νE dE = −(uECR , div τ ).

Hence

(∇NC uECR , τ ) + (Π0 uECR , div τ ) = 0,
which is the first equation of Problem (2.11). To prove the second equation of Problem

∇NC uECR · νE φK dE.
(f, φK ) = (∇NC uECR , ∇NC φK ) = −(div ∇NC uECR , φK ) +

φK dE = 0, this yields

div ∇NC uECR (1, φK ) = −fK (1, φK ) ⇒ div ∇NC uECR = −fK ,
which completes the proof.

3.2. Equivalence between the ECR and RT elements for the Stokes equation.
Lemma 3.4. Let (uECR , pECR ) be the solution of Problem (2.8). There holds that
∇NC uECR + pECR id ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn×n ).
Proof. The proof is actually similar to that of Lemma 3.1. Let (σRT , uRT ) be the
solution of Problem (2.13). Given any v ∈ (VECR )n , it follows from an integration by
parts and the second equation of Problem (2.13) that
XZ
σRT νE [v]dE = (f , v).
(σRT , ∇NC v) = (f , v) +
E∈E

E

This and the first equation of Problem (2.8) give
(∇NC uECR + pECR id −σRT , ∇NC v) = 0 for any v ∈ (VECR )n .
Given any E ∈ E(Ω), let vE be defined as in the proof of Lemma 3.1. Define vE =
(vE , · · · , vE )T , this yields
0 = − (divNC (∇NC uECR + pECR id −σRT ), vE )

Since σRT ∈

this proves the desired result.

Theorem 3.5. Let (uECR , pECR ) be the solution of Problem (2.8), and let (σRT , uRT )
be the solution of Problem (2.13). Then there holds that
σRT = ∇NC uECR + pECR id and uRT = Π0 uECR + LuECR ,
where LuECR ∈ (URT )n is defined by
c ))n .
(LuECR , div τ ) = (divNC uECR , tr τ /n) for any τ ∈ (RT(T

Remark 3.6. Since Π0 divNC uECR = 0 and div τ = 0 implies that τ is a piecewise
constant matrix–valued function, the operator L is well–defined.
Proof. We prove that (∇NC uECR +pECR id, Π0 uECR +LuECR ) is the solution of Problem
(2.13). We start with a simple but important property of the deviatoric operator dev
as follows
(dev σ, dev τ ) = (σ, dev τ ) = (dev σ, τ ) for any σ, τ ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn×n ).
c ))n admits the following decomposition:
Hence, any τ ∈ (RT(T

(3.3)

(dev(∇NC uECR + pECR id), dev τ ) = (dev ∇NC uECR , τ ) = (∇NC uECR , dev τ )
= (∇NC uECR , τ ) − (divNC uECR , tr τ /n).

9

After integrating by parts, the first term on the right–hand side of (3.3) can be rewritten
as
(∇NC uECR , τ ) = −(uECR , div τ ) = −(Π0 uECR , div τ )
since

τ νE dE = 0. This proves that

(dev(∇NC uECR + pECR id), dev τ ) + (Π0 uECR + LuECR , div τ ) = 0,

which is the first equation of Problem (2.13). Given any K, define vK = (φK , · · · , φK ).
Let v = vK in (2.4). After integrating by parts, we derive as

Since it is obvious that Ω divNC uECR dx = 0, ∇NC uECR + pECR id ∈ (RT(T

3.3. Comments on the Poisson problem with the pure Neumann boundary.
Given a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rn with n ≥ 2 and f ∈ L2 (Ω, R), the Poisson model
problem with the pure Neumann boundary condition finds u ∈ Ĥ 1 (Ω, R) := {v ∈
R
H 1 (Ω, R) : Ω vdx = 0} such that
(3.4)

(∇u, ∇v) = (f, v)+ < g, v >

for all v ∈ Ĥ 1 (Ω, R).

−1/2 (∂Ω, R). Suppose that (f, v)+ < g, v >= 0, this problem
where g|∂Ω := ∂u
∂ν |∂Ω ∈ H
admits a unique solution. For this problem, the equivalent mixed formulation seeks
(σ, u) ∈ Hg (div, Rn ) × L2 (Ω, R) such that

(3.5)

(σ, τ ) + (u, div τ ) = 0
(div σ, v) = (−f, v)

for any τ ∈ H0 (div, Ω, Rn ),
for any v ∈ L2 (Ω, R).

Here
HD (div, Rn ) = {τ ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ) : τ · ν = D on ∂Ω} with D = 0 or g.
Suppose that both f and g are a piecewise constant function. Then the result in (1.1)
holds equally for this case. Since the space for the CR element is a subspace of the
ECR element, this implies that the CR element can not be equal to the RT element.
In fact, for two dimensions, let the exact solution of Problem (3.4) be u = x21 + x22 ,
which yields that f = −4 and g is a piecewise constant on a polygonal domain. For this
problem, the RT element gives the exact solution while the error of the CR element
has the following lower bound
βh ≤ k∇NC (u − uCR )k
for some positive constant β and the meshsize h of the domain, see [21] for more details
of proof.

4. Equivalence between the ECR and RT elements for eigenvalue
problem
First we introduce the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator and the finite
element method in this section. The eigenvalue problem finds (λ, u) ∈ R × H01 (Ω, R)
such that
(4.1)

(∇u, ∇v) = λ(u, v) for any v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) and kuk = 1.

By introducing an auxiliary variable σ := ∇u, the problem can be formulated as the
following equivalent mixed problem which seeks (λ, σ, u) ∈ R×H(div, Ω, Rn )×L2 (Ω, R)
such that
(σ, τ ) + (u, div τ ) = 0 for any τ ∈ H(div, Ω, Rn ),
(4.2)
(div σ, v) = −λ(u, v) for any v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) and kuk = 1.
The ECR element method of (4.1) seeks (λECR , uECR ) ∈ R × VECR such that
(4.3)

(∇NC uECR , ∇NC v) = λECR (uECR , v) for any v ∈ VECR and kuECR k = 1.

The RT element method of Problem (4.2) seeks (λRT , σRT , uRT ) ∈ R × RT(T ) × URT
such that
(σRT , τ ) + (uRT , div τ ) = 0 for any τ ∈ RT(T ),
(4.4)
(div σRT , v) = −λRT (uRT , v) for any v ∈ URT and kuRT k = 1.
Assume, for simplicity, we only consider the case of λ is an eigenvalue of multiplicity
1. We define T as the inverse operator of continuous problem, i.e. for any f ∈ L2 (Ω, R),
T f = uf ∈ H01 (Ω, R), where uf satisfies the Poisson equation (2.1), i.e.
(4.5)

(∇uf , ∇v) = (f, v)

for any v ∈ H01 (Ω, R).

Generally speaking, the regularity of uf depends on, among others, regularities of
f and the shape of the domain Ω. To fix the main idea and therefore avoid too
technical notation, throughout the remaining paper, without loss of generality, assume
that uf ∈ H01 (Ω, R) ∩ H 1+s (Ω, R) with 0 < s ≤ 1 in the sense that
(4.6)

kuf kH 1+s (Ω,R) . kf k.

Here and throughout the paper, the inequality A . B replaces A ≤ CB with some
multiplicative mesh–size independent constant C > 0 that depends on the domain Ω,
the shape of element, and possibly the eigenvalue λ.
It follows from the theory of nonconforming eigenvalue approximation [21] and known
a priori estimate that,
(4.7)

|λ − λECR | + ku − uECR k + hs k∇NC (u − uECR )k . h2s kukH 1+s (Ω,R)

and the theory of mixed eigenvalue approximation [28] that
(4.8)

|λ − λRT | + hs (kσ − pRT k + ku − uRT k) . h2s kukH 1+s (Ω,R) .

Using (4.6), the bound for the eigenvalue λ . 1 and kuk = 1, there holds that
kukH 1+s (Ω,R) . kλuk . 1.

To analyze the equivalence, we introduce the following discrete problem: Find φECR ∈
VECR such that
(4.9)

(∇NC φECR , ∇NC v) = λRT (Π0 φECR , v) for any v ∈ VECR .

It follows from Theorem 3.3 that Problem (4.4) is equivalent to (4.9) in the sense that
they have the same eigenvalues λRT and the eigenvectors are related by σRT = ∇NC φECR
and uRT = Π0 φECR .
Similar to the analysis in [17], applying to Problem (4.9) the general theory developed
for example in [5] we can prove that
ku − φ̄ECR k . h2s ,

(4.10)

where φ̄ECR = φECR /kφECR k. To present it clearly, we follow a similar argument in [17]
and give the proof of (4.10). Let Th be defined as the inverse operators of the following
discrete problem, i.e., for f ∈ L2 (Ω, R), Th f = wh ∈ VECR where wh satisfies
(4.11)

(∇NC wh , ∇NC v) = (Π0 f, v) for any v ∈ VECR .

Let E denote the eigenspace corresponding to λ. We have the following two results.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose T is defined in (4.5) and Th is defined in (4.11). Then,
k(T − Th )|E kL(L2 ,L2 ) . h2s .
Proof. We have to show that
kT f − Th f k . h2s kf k for any f ∈ E.
Let uf = T f , uΠ0 f = T (Π0 f ) and wh = Th f . First a standard argument for nonconforming finite element methods, see, for instance, [7], proves
(4.12)

kT (Π0 f ) − Th f k = kuΠ0 f − wh k . h2s kΠ0 f k . h2s kf k.

Let e = uf − uΠ0 f and r ∈ H01 (Ω, R) be the solution of −∆r = e. Then a standard
duality argument gives,
(4.13)

(e, e) = (∇e, ∇r) = (f − Π0 f, r)
= (f − Π0 f, r − Π0 r).

Hence, the property of piecewise constant L2 projection Π0 implies that
kek . h2 k∇f k.
Since f ∈ E, there exists a constant C depending on λ such that k∇f k ≤ Ckf k and so
kek . h2 kf k.
This and (4.12) complete the proof.

Lemma 4.2. The sequence {Th }h converges uniformly to T in L(L2 , L2 ) as h goes to
0.

Proof. We show that for all f ∈ L2 (Ω, R) we have
kT f − Th f k . hmin{2s,1} kf k.
The proof follows the same lines as the previous lemma. The fact that f belonged to
the eigenspace E was used only once to estimate (4.13) with the desired order. When
f is taken in L2 (Ω, R) we can only obtain from the following bound, using similar
arguments as before
(e, e) = (∇e, ∇r) = (f − Π0 f, r)
= (f − Π0 f, r − Π0 r)
. hkf − Π0 f kk∇rk
. hkf kkek.
This and (4.12) imply the desired order.



Since the sequence of operators {Th }h converges uniformly to T in L(L2 , L2 ), wellknown results in the theory of spectral approximation yield the following error estimate
for eigenvectors, see e.g. [5]
(4.14)

ku − φ̄ECR k . k(T − Th )|E kL(L2 ,L2 ) .

Then (4.10) is a consequence of (4.14) and Lemma 4.1. In fact,
kφECR k2 = k(I − Π0 )φECR k2 + kΠ0 φECR k2
= 1 + k(I − Π0 )φECR k2 .
This and the property of piecewise constant L2 projection Π0 yield 0 ≤ kφECR k − 1 .
λRT h2 , and so φECR satisfies
(4.15)

ku − φECR k . h2s .

The equivalence result for the errors of the eigenfunction approximations is presented
as follows.
Theorem 4.3. For sufficiently small h ≪ 1, the discrete eigenfunctions uECR and σRT
satisfy
k∇u − ∇NC uECR k = k∇u − σRT k + h.o.t.
Proof. Using (4.9) and some elementary manipulation yield
k∇NC uECR − σRT k2 =k∇NC uECR − ∇NC φECR k2
=(λECR uECR − λRT Π0 φECR , uECR − φECR )
(4.16)

=(λECR uECR − λRT φECR , uECR − φECR )
+ λRT ((I − Π0 )φECR , (I − Π0 )(uECR − φECR ))
.kλECR uECR − λRT φECR kkuECR − φECR k
+ λRT h2 k∇NC φECR kk∇NC uECR − σRT k.

13

The bound for the eigenvalues λECR . 1,λRT . 1 and the normalisation kuECR k = 1
yield
kλECR uECR − λRT φECR k . |λECR − λRT | + kuECR − φECR k.
Therefore, the Young inequalities, (4.7) and (4.15) control the first term in (4.16) as
kλECR uECR − λRT φECR kkuECR − φECR k
. |λECR − λRT |2 + kuECR − φECR k2 . h4s .
The last term in (4.16) can be absorbed. Hence it yields that
k∇NC uECR − σRT k . h2s ,
which is a high order term.

5. Numerical results

In this section, we present some numerical results, which show that ECR elements
have some good numerical properties.
5.1. Poisson problem. We consider the poisson problem (2.1). Define the bubble
function space
BECR := {v ∈ L2 (Ω, R) : v|K ∈ span{φK }, ∀K ∈ T },
where φK is defined in (3.1). For any v ∈ VECR , Πv ∈ VCR is given by
Z
Z
vds for all E ∈ E.
Πvds =
E

E

Hence v − Πv has vanishing average on each E and v − Πv ∈ BECR . Let uECR be the
solution to the discrete problem by the ECR element, then uECR can be written as
uECR = ΠuECR + ub , where ΠuECR ∈ VCR and ub ∈ BECR . In (2.6), we choose
(
φK
x ∈ K,
v=
0
x 6∈ K.
This gives
R

(∇uECR , ∇φK )L2 (K) = (f, φK )L2 (K) .

Since Ei φK dE = 0, i = 1, · · · , n + 1, an integration by parts leads to the following
important orthogonality:
(5.1)

(∇ΠuECR , ∇φK )L2 (K) = 0.

This leads to
(5.2)

(∇ub , ∇φK )L2 (K) = (f, φK )L2 (K)

∀K ∈ T ,

and
(5.3)

(∇NC ΠuECR , ∇NC v) = (f, v) for all v ∈ VCR .

Consequently, ΠuECR is the solution to the discrete problem by the CR element. Hence
we can solve the ECR element by solving (5.2) on each K and (5.3) for the CR element,
respectively.

14

Remark 5.1. For general second order elliptic problems: Find u ∈ H01 (Ω, R) such that
(A∇u, ∇v) = (f, v)

for all v ∈ H01 (Ω, R),

when A is a piecewise constant tensor-valued function, a similar orthogonality of (5.1)
still holds
(5.4)

(A∇ΠuECR , ∇φK )L2 (K) = 0

∀K ∈ T .

Hence, we can still use the same technique to solve the ECR element. For the more
general case, the orthogonality (5.4) does not hold. However, ub can be eliminated a
prior by a static condensation procedure.
We compute two examples which compare the errors of the ECR and CR elements.
The first example takes Ω = (0, 1)2 and the exact solution u(x, y) = sin(πx) sin(πy);
the second takes Ω = (0, 1)3 and the exact solution u(x, y, z) = sin(πx) sin(πy) sin(πz).
Both comparisons are illustrated in Figure 1, which indicates that k∇NC (u − uECR )k is
smaller than k∇NC (u − uCR )k.

5.2. Eigenvalue problem. We consider the eigenvalue problem (4.1). Since VCR ⊂
VECR , the eigenvalues produced by the ECR element are smaller than those by the CR
element. When the meshsize is small enough, the ECR element has been proved to
produce lower bounds for eigenvalues, see [21]. When eigenfunctions are singular, the
CR element provides lower bounds for eigenvalues, see [2]; under some mesh conditions,
it also produces lower bounds for eigenvalues when eigenfunctions are smooth, see [22].
On the coarse triangulation of the square domain Ω = (0, 1)2 from Figure 2, the CR
element produces a upper bound λCR = 24 for the first eigenvalue λ = 2π 2 ≈ 19.7392
of the Laplace operator, while the ECR element gives a lower bound λECR = 17.1429.
