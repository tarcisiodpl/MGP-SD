17).

The direct effect of one event on another can
be defined and measured by holding constant
all intermediate variables between the two.
Indirect effects present conceptual and prac­
tical difficulties (in nonlinear models), be­
cause they cannot be isolated by holding cer­
tain variables constant. This paper presents
a new way of defining the effect transmit­
ted through a restricted set of paths, without
controlling variables on the remaining paths.
T his permits the assessment of a more nat­
ural type of direct and indirect effects, one
that is applicable in both linear and nonlinear
models and that has broader policy-related
interpretations. The paper establishes con­
ditions under which such assessments can
be estimated consistently from experimen­
tal and nonexperimental data, and thus ex­
tends path-analytic techniques to nonlinear
and nonparametric models.

The causal relationship that is easiest to interpret,
define and estimate is the total effect. Written as
P(Y"'
y), the total effect measures the probability
that response variable Y would take on the value y
when X is set to x by external intervention.2 This
probability function is what we normally assess in a
controlled experiment in which X is randomized and
in which the distribution of Y is estimated for each
level x of X.

INTRODUCTION

The distinction between total, direct, and indirect ef­
fects is deeply entrenched in causal conversations, and
attains practical importance in many applications, in­
cluding policy decisions, legal definitions and health
care analysis. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
(Goldberger 1972), which provides a methodology of
defining and estimating such effects, has been re­
stricted to linear analysis, and no comparable method­
ology has been devised to extend these capabilities
to models involving nonlinear dependencies,1 as those
1 A notable exception is the counterfactual analysis of
Robins and Greenland (1992) which is applicable to non­
linear models, but does not incorporate path-analytic tech­
niques.

In many cases, however, this quantity does not ade­
quately represent the target of investigation and at­
tention is focused instead on the direct effect of X on
Y. The term "direct effect" is meant to quantify an
influence that is not mediated by other variables in
the model or, more accurately, the sensitivity of Y to
changes in X while all other factors in the analysis are
held fixed. Naturally, holding those factors fixed would
sever all causal paths from X to Y with the exception
of the direct link X ---t Y, which is not intercepted by
any intermediaries.
Indirect effects cannot be define in this manner, be­
cause it is impossible to hold a set of variables con­
stant in such a way that the effect of X on Y mea­
sured under those conditions would circumvent the di­
rect pathway, if such exists. Thus, the definition of
indirect effects has remained incomplete, and, save for
asserting inequality between direct and total effects,
the very concept of "indirect effect" was deemed void
of operational meaning (Pearl 2000, p. 165).
This paper shows that it is possible to give an op­
erational meaning to both direct and indirect effects

potential-outcome framework of Rubin (1974).

(2000) used, interchangeably, P, (y), P(yido(x)), P(yix),
and P(yx), and showed their equivalence to probabilities of
subjunctive conditionals: P((X

without fixing variables in the model, thus extending
the applicability of these concepts to nonlinear and
nonparametric models. The proposed generalization
is based on a more subtle interpretation of " effects" ,
here called "descriptive" (see Section 2.2), which con­
cerns the action of causal forces under natural, rather
than experimental conditions, and provides answers to
a broader class of policy-related questions. This inter­
pretation yields the standard path-coefficients in linear
models, but leads to different formal definitions and
different estimation procedures of direct and indirect
effects in nonlinear models.
Following a conceptual discussion of the descriptive
and prescriptive interpretations (Section 2.2), Section
2.3 illustrates their distinct roles in decision-making
contexts, while Section 2.4 discusses the descriptive
basis and policy implications of indirect effects. Sec­
tions 3.2 and 3.3 provide, respectively, mathematical
formulation of the prescriptive and descriptive inter­
pretations of direct effects, while Section 3.4 estab­
lishes conditions under which the descriptive (or "nat­
ural") interpretation can be estimated consistently
from either experimental or nonexperimental data.
Sections 3.5 and 3.6 extend the formulation and iden­
tification analysis to indirect effects. In Section 3.7, we
generalize the notion of indirect effect to path-specific
effects, that is, effects transmitted through any speci­
fied set of paths in the model.

2.1

CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS
Direct versus Total Effects

A classical example of the ubiquity of direct effects
(Hesslow 1976) tells the story of a birth-control pill
that is suspect of producing thrombosis in women and,
at the same time, has a negative indirect effect on
thrombosis by reducing the rate of pregnancies (preg­
nancy is known to encourage thrombosis). In this ex­
ample, interest is focused on the direct effect of the
pill because it represents a stable biological relation­
ship that, unlike the total effect, is invariant to mar­
ital status and other factors that may affect women's
chances of getting pregnant or of sustaining pregnancy.
This invariance makes the direct effect transportable
across cultural and sociological boundaries and, hence,
a more useful quantity in scientific explanation and
policy analysis.
Another class of examples involves legal disputes over
race or sex discrimination in hiring. Here, neither the
effect of sex or race on applicants' qualification nor
the effect of qualification on hiring are targets of lit­
igation. Rather, defendants must prove that sex and
race do not directly influence hiring decisions, what-

UAI 2001

ever indirect effects they might have on hiring by way
of applicant qualification. This is made quite explicit
in the following court ruling:
"The central question in any employment­
discrimination case is whether the employer
would have taken the same action had the
employee been of a different race (age, sex,
religion, national origin etc.) and everything
else had been the same." (Carson versus
Bethlehem Steel Corp., 70 FEP Cases 921,
7th Cir. (1996), Quoted in Gastwirth 1997.)
Taking this criterion as a guideline, the direct effect
of X on Y (in our case X=gender Y =hiring) can
roughly be defined as the response of Y to change in
X (say from X = x• to X = x) while keeping all
other accessible variables at their initial value, namely,
the value they would have attained under X = x• .3
This doubly-hypothetical criterion will be given pre­
cise mathematical formulation in Section 3, using the
language and semantics of structural counterfactuals
(Pearl 2000; chapter 7).
As a third example, one that illustrates the policy­
making ramifications of direct and total effects, con­
sider a drug treatment that has a side effect headache. Patients who suffer from headache tend to
take aspirin which, in turn may have its own effect on
the disease or, may strengthen (or weaken) the impact
of the drug on the disease. To determine how bene­
ficial the drug is to the population as a whole, under
existing patterns of aspirin usage, the total effect of
the drug is the target of analysis, and the difference
P(Yx = y) - P(Yx• = y) may serve to assist the de­
cision, with x and x• being any two treatment levels.
However, to decide whether aspirin should be encour­
aged or discouraged during the treatment, the direct
effect of the drug on the disease, both with aspirin and
without aspirin, should be the target of investigation.
The appropriate expression for analysis would then be
the difference P(Yxz = y) - P(Yx•z = y), where z
stands for any specified level of aspirin intake.
In linear systems, direct effects are fully specified by
the corresponding path coefficients, and are indepen­
dent of the values at which we hold the the interme­
diate variables (Z in our examples). In nonlinear sys­
tems, those values would, in general, modify the effect
of X on Y and thus should be chosen carefully to rep­
resent the target policy under analysis. This lead to a
basic distinction between two types of conceptualiza­
tions: prescriptive and descriptive.
3

Robins and Greenland (1992) have adapted essentially

the same criterion (phrased differently) for their interpre­
tation of "direct effect" in epidemiology.

PEARL

Descriptive versus prescriptive
interpretation

We will illustrate this distinction using the treatment­
aspirin example described in the last section. In the
prescriptive conceptualization, we ask whether a spe­
cific untreated patient would improve if treated, while
holding the aspirin intake fixed at some predetermined
level, say Z = z. In the descriptive conceptualization,
we ask again whether the untreated patient would im­
prove if treated, but now we hold the aspirin intake
fixed at whatever level the patient currently consumes
under no-treatment condition. The difference between
these two conceptualizations lies in whether we wish to
account for the natural relationship between the direct
and the mediating cause (that is, between treatment
and aspirin) or to modify that relationship to match
policy objectives. We call the effect computed from
the descriptive perspective the natural effect, and the
one computed from the prescriptive perspective the
controlled effect.
Consider a patient who takes aspirin if and only if
treated, and for whom the treatment is effective only
when aspirin is present. For such a person, the treat­
ment is deemed to have no natural direct effect (on
recovery), because, by keeping the aspirin at the cur­
rent, pre-treatment level of zero, we ensure that the
treatment effect would be nullified. The controlled di­
rect effect, however, is nonzero for this person, because
the efficacy of the treatment would surface when we
fix the aspirin intake at non-zero level. Note that the
descriptive formulation requires knowledge of the in­
dividual natural behavior�in our example, whether
the untreated patient actually uses aspirin-while the
prescriptive formulation requires no such knowledge.
This difference becomes a major stumbling block when
it comes to estimating average direct effects in a pop­
ulation of individuals. At the population level, the
prescriptive formulation is pragmatic; we wish to pre­
dict the difference in recovery rates between treated
and untreated patients when a prescribed dose of as­
pirin is administered to all patients in the population­
the actual consumption of aspirin under uncontrolled
conditions need not concern us. In contrast, the de­
scriptive formulation is attributional; we ask whether
an observed improvement in recovery rates (again, be­
tween treated and untreated patients) is attributable
to the treatment itself, as opposed to preferential use
of aspirin among treated patients. To properly distin­
guish between these two contributions, we therefore
need to measure the improvement in recovery rates
while making each patient take the same level of as­
pirin that he/she took before treatment. However, as
Robins and Greenland (1992) pointed out, such con­
trol over individual behavior would require testing the

413

same group of patients twice (i.e., under treatment and
no treatment conditions), and cannot be administered
in experiments with two different groups, however ran­
domized. (There is no way to determine what level
of aspirin an untreated patient would take if treated,
unless we actually treat that patient and, then, this
patient could no longer be eligible for the untreated
group.) Since repeatable tests on the same individu­
als are rarely feasible, the descriptive measure of the
direct effect is not generally estimable from standard
experimental studies. In Section 3.4 we will analyze
what additional assumptions are required for consis­
tently estimating this measure, the average natural di­
rect effect, from either experimental or observational
studies.
2.3

Policy implications of the Descriptive
interpretation

Why would anyone be interested in assessing the aver­
age natural direct effect? Assume that the drug manu­
facturer is considering ways of eliminating the adverse
side-effect of the drug, in our case, the headache. A
natural question to ask is whether the drug would still
retain its effectiveness in the population of interest.
The controlled direct effect would not give us the an­
swer to this question, because it refers to a specific
aspirin level, taken uniformly by all individuals. Our
target population is one where aspirin intake varies
from individual to individual, depending on other fac­
tors beside drug-induced headache, factors which may
also cause the effectiveness of the drug to vary from
individual to individual. Therefore, the parameter we
need to assess is the average natural direct effect, as
described in the Subsection 2.2.
This example demonstrates that the descriptive inter­
pretation of direct effects is not purely "descriptive";
it carries a definite operational implications, and an­
swers policy-related questions of practical significance.
Moreover, note that the policy question considered in
this example cannot be represented in the standard
syntax of do(x) operators�it does not involve fixing
any of the variables in the model but, rather, modify­
ing the causal paths in the model. Even if "headache"
were a genuine variable in our model, the elimination
of any drug-induced headache is not equivalent to set­
ting any "headache" to zero, since a person might get
headache for reason other than the drug. Instead, the
policy option involves the de-activation of the causal
path from "drug" to "headache" .
In general, the average natural direct effect would be
of interest in evaluating policy options of a more re­
fined variety, ones that involve, not merely fixing the
levels of the variables in the model, but also deter­
mining how these levels would influence one another.

PEARL

41 4

Typical examples of such options involve choosing the
manner (e.g., instrument, or timing) in which a given

decision is implemented, or choosing the agents that
should be informed about the decision. A firm of­
ten needs to assess, for example, whether it would
be worthwhile to conceal a certain decision from a
competitor. This amounts, again, to evaluating the
natural direct effect of the decision in question, un­
mediated by the competitor's reaction. Theoretically,
such policy options could conceivably be represented
as (values of) variables in a more refined model, for
example one where the concept "the effect of treat­
ment on headache" would be given a variable name,
and where the manufacturer decision to eliminate side­
effects would be represented by fixing this hypothetical
variable to zero. The analysis of this paper shows that
such unnatural modeling techniques can be avoided,
and that important nonstandard policy questions can
be handled by standard models, where variables stands
for directly measurable quantities.
2.4

Descriptive interpretation of indirect
effects

The descriptive conception of direct effects can eas­
ily be transported to the formulation of indirect ef­
fects; oddly, the prescriptive formulation is not trans­
portable. Returning to our treatment-aspirin exam­
ple, if we wish to assess the natural indirect effect of
treatment on recovery for a specific patient, we with­
hold treatment and ask, instead, whether that patient
would recover if given as much aspirin as he/she would
have taken if he/she had been under treatment. In this
way, we insure that whatever changes occur in the pa­
tient's condition are due to treatment-induced aspirin
consumption and not to the treatment itself. Similarly,
at the population level, the natural indirect effect of
the treatment is interpreted as the improvement in re­
covery rates if we were to withhold treatment from all
patients but, instead, let each patient take the same
level of aspirin that he/she would have taken under
treatment. As in the descriptive formulation of di­
rect effects, this hypothetical quantity involves nested
counterfactuals and will be identifiable only under spe­
cial circumstances.
The prescriptive formulation has no parallel in indi­
rect effects, for reasons discussed in the introduction
section; there is no way of preventing the direct effect
from operating by holding certain variables constant.
We will see that, in linear systems, the descriptive and
prescriptive formulations of direct effects lead, indeed,
to the same expression in terms of path coefficients.
The corresponding linear expression for indirect ef­
fects, computed as the difference between the total
and direct effects, coincides with the descriptive for-

UAI2001

mulation but finds no prescriptive interpretation.
The operational implications of indirect effects, like
those of natural direct effect, concern nonstandard pol­
icy options. Although it is impossible, by controlling
variables, to block a direct path (i.e., a single edge),
if such exists, it is nevertheless possible to block such
a path by more refined policy options, ones that de­
activate the direct path through the manner in which
an action is taken or through the mode by which a
variable level is achieved. In the hiring discrimination
example, if we make it illegal to question applicants
about their gender, (and if no other indication of gen­
der are available to the hiring agent), then any residual
sex preferences (in hiring) would be attributable to the
indirect effect of sex on hiring. A policy maker might
well be interested in predicting the magnitude of such
preferences from data obtained prior to implementing
the no-questioning policy, and the average indirect ef­
fect would then provide the sought for prediction. A
similar refinement applies in the firm-competitor ex­
ample of the preceding subsection. A firm might wish
to assess, for example, the economical impact of bluff­
ing a competitor into believing that a certain deci­
sion has been taken by the firm, and this could be
implemented by (secretly) instructing certain agents
to ignore the decision. In both cases, our model may
not be sufficiently detailed to represents such policy
options in the form of variable fixing (e.g., the agents
may not be represented as intermediate nodes between
the decision and its effect) and the task amounts then
to evaluating the average natural indirect effects in a
coarse-grain model, where a direct link exists between
the decision and its outcome.

FORMAL ANALYSIS
Notation

Throughout our analysis we will let X be the control
variable (whose effect we seek to assess), and let Y be
the response variable. We will let Z stand for the set of
all intermediate variables between X and Y which, in
the simplest case considered, would be a single variable
as in Figure 1 (a). Most of our results will still be
valid if we let Z stand for any set of such variables, in
particular, the set of Y's parents excluding X.
We will use the counterfactual notation Yx (u) to de­
note the value that Y would attain in unit (or situa­
tion) U = u under the control regime do(X = x). See
Pearl (2000, Chapter 7) for formal semantics of these
counterfactual utterances. Many concepts associated
with direct and indirect effect require comparison to a
reference value of X, that is, a value relative to which
we measure changes. We will designate this reference

Alternatively, the ratio Yxz(u)/Yx•z(u), the propor­
tional difference (Yxz(u)- Yx•z(u))/Yx•z(u), or some
other suitable relationship might be used to quantify
the magnitude of the direct effect; the difference is
by far the most common measure, and will be used
throughout this paper.

(Average controlled direct effect)
Given a probabilistic causal model (M, P(u)), the con­
trolled direct effect of event X = x on Y is defined
as:
(3)
CDE z(x, x*; Y) = E(Yxz - Yx•z)
where the expectation is taken over u.

Definition 3

The distribution P(Yxz = y) can be estimated consis­
tently from experimental studies in which both X and
Z are randomized. In nonexperimental studies, the
identification of this distribution requires that certain
"no-confo unding" assumptions hold true in the pop­
ulation tested. Graphical criteria encapsulating these
assumptions are described in Pearl (2000, Sections 4.3
and 4.4).

We can easily extend this definition from events to
variables by defining X as having a natural direct effect
on Y (in model M and situation U = u ) if there exist
two values, x* and x, that satisfy ( 4). N ote that this
definition no longer requires that we specify a val ue z
for Z; that value is determined naturally by the model,
once we specify x, x*, and u. N ote also that conditi on

direct effect, one can take the difference

Natural Direct Effects: Identification

the average natural direct-effect from empirical data.

the former governs the causal effect of X on Y (ob­
tained by randomizing X) and the latter governs the
causal effect of X and Z on Y (obtained by random­
izing both X and Z).
We now present conditions under which such reduction
is nevertheless feasible.

implies the latter for every pair of values, x and x*,
of X (see (Pearl 2000, p. 214)). Likewise, condition
(7) can be relaxed in several ways. However, since
assumptions of counterfactual independencies can be
meaningfully substantiated only when cast in struc­
tural form (Pearl2000, p. 244-5), graphical conditions
will be the target of our analysis.

yields the following criterion for identification:

experimental data requires stronger conditions.

Natural Indirect Effects: Formulation

As we discussed in Section 2.4, the prescriptive for­
mulation of "controlled direct effect" has no parallel
in indirect effects; we therefore use the descriptive for­
mulation, and define natural indirect effects at b oth
the unit and population levels. Lacking the controlled
alternative, we will drop the title "natural" from dis­
cussions of indirect effects, unless it serves to convey a
contrast.

(Unit-level indirect effect; qualitative)
An event X = x is said to have an indirect effect on
variable Y in situation U = u if the following inequal­
ity holds

Definition 6

(18)

PEARL

In words, the value of Y changes when we keep X fixed
at its reference level X == x* and change Z to a new
value, Z, (u), the same value that Z would attain under

X = x.

Taking the difference between the two sides of Eq. (18),
we can define the unit level indirect effect as

NIE(x, x*;Y,u) = Y.,.,z.(u)(u)- Y .,.(u)

(19)

and proceed to define its average in the population:

The average indirect effect of event X = x. on variable
Y, denoted NIE(x,x*; Y), is defined as

NIE(x,x*; Y) = E(Y.,·,zJ- E(Y,.)

Natural Indirect Effects: Identification

Eqs. (22) and (23) show that the indirect effect is iden­
tified whenever both the total and the (natural) direct
effect are identified (for all x and x*). Moreover, the
identification conditions and the resulting expressions
for indirect effects are identical to the corresponding
ones for direct effects (Theorems I and 2), save for
a simple exchange of the indices x and x*. This is
explicated in the following theorem.

If there exists a set W of covariates, non­
descendants of X or Z, such that

Theorem 4

(25)
for all x and z, then the average indirect-effect is ex­
perimentally identifiable, and it is given by

NIE(x, x*; Y)
=

Comparing Eqs. (6) and {20), we see that the indirect
effect associated with the transition from x* to x is
closely related to the natural direct effect associated
with the reverse transition, from x to x*. In fact, re­
calling that the difference E(Y,) - E(Y,.) equals the
total effect of X = x on Y,

TE(x, x*; Y)

=

E(Y,)- E(Y.,.)

w,z

=

z/w)- P(Z.,.

=

z)w)JP(w)
(26)

Moreover, the average indirect effect is identified in
nonexperimental studies whenever the following ex­
pressions are identified for all z and w:

E(Yx·z / w), P(Z,

(21)

=

ziw) and P(Z,.

ziw),

with W satisfying Eq. {25).

we obtain the following theorem:
The total, direct and indirect effects obey
the following relationships

Theorem 3

TE(x, x*;Y) = NIE(x, x*;Y)- NDE(x*,x;Y) (22)
TE(x, x*; Y) = NDE(x, x*;Y)- NIE(x*,x;Y) (23)
In words, the total effect (on Y) associated with the
transition from x* to x is equal to the difference be­
tween the indirect effect associated with this transition
and the ( naturaQ direct effect associated with the re­
verse transition, from x to x*.

As strange as these relationships appear, they produce
the standard, additive relation

TE(x, x*; Y) = NIE(x, x*; Y)

LE(Yx•z/w)[P(Z.,

+

NDE(x,x*; Y)
(24)

when applied to linear models. The reason is clear; in
linear systems the effect of the transition from x* to x
is proportional to x- x*, hence it is always equal and
of opposite sign to the effect of the reverse transition.
Thus, substituting in (22) (or (23)), yields (24).

In the simple Markovian model depicted in Fig. 2(b),
Eq. (26) reduces to

NIE(x,x*; Y) = LE(Yix*,z)[P(zix)- P(zix*)] (27)
z

Contrasting Eq. (27) with Eq. (I 7), we see that the ex­
pression for the indirect effect fixes X at the reference
value x•, and lets z vary according to its distribution
under the post-transition value of X = x. The ex­
pression for the direct effect fixes X at x, and lets z
vary according to its distribution under the reference
conditions X= x•.
Applied to the sex discrimination example of Section
2.1, Eq. (27) measures the expected change in male
hiring, E(Y,. ) , if males were trained to acquire (in
distribution) equal qualifications (Z = z) as those of
females (X= x).

General Path-specific Effects

The analysis of the last section suggests that path­
specific effects can best be understood in terms of a
path-deactivation process, where a selected set of paths,
rather than nodes, are forced to remain inactive during

the transition from X = x• to X = x. In Figure 3, for
example, if we wish to evaluate the effect of X on Y
transmitted by the subgraph g : X --+ Z --+ W --+ Y,
we cannot hold Z or W constant, for both must vary
in the process. Rather, we isolate the desired effect
by fixing the appropriate subset of arguments in each
equation. In other words, we replace x with x* in the
equation for W, and replace z with z*(u) = Zx· (u)
in the equation for Y. This amounts to creating a
new model, in which each structural function J; in M
is replaced with a new function of a smaller set of
arguments, since some of the arguments are replaced
by constants. The following definition expresses this
idea formally.
Definition 8

(path-specific effect)
Let G be the the causal graph associated with model
M, and let g be an edge-subgraph of G containing the
paths selected for effect analysis. The g-specific effect
of x on Y (relative to reference x*) is defined as the
total effect of x on Y in a modified model M; formed
as follows. Let each parent set P A; in G be partitioned
into two parts

Figure 3: The path-specific effect transmitted through
X --+ Z --+ W --+ Y (heavy lines) in (a) is equal to
the total effect transmitted through the model in (b),
treating x* and z*(u) as constants. (By convention, u
is not shown in the diagram.)
and our task amounts to computing the total effect of
x on Y in M;, or

TE(x,x*;Y,u)M•g =
jy( z* (u), fw(fz(x, uz),x*, uw) , uy)
-Yx• (u)
(32)

(28)
where PA;(g) represents those members of PA; that
are linked to X; in g, and P A;(g) represents the com­
plementary set, from which there is no link to X; in g.
We replace each function j;(pa;, u) with a new func­
tion ft (pa;, u; g), defined as

ft(pa;, u; g)

=

f;(pai(g),pa: (g), u)

(29)

where pai (g) stands for the values that the variables
in P A; (g) would attain (in M and u) under X = x*
(that is, pai (g) = PA; (g) x• ) . The g-specific effect of
x on Y, denoted SE9(x,x*;Y,u)M is defined as

SE9(x, x*;Y,u)M

=

TE(x,x*;Y,u)M··

(30)

We demonstrate this construction in the model of Fig.
3 which stands for the equations:

z

fz(x,u z)
fw(z,x, uw)
fy( z,w,uy)

where uz, uw, and uy are the components of u that
enter the corresponding equations. Defining z*(u)
fz(x*,uz), the modified model M; reads:
=

z

fz(x,uz)
= fw(z,x",uw) and
jy(z*(u),w,uy)

(31)

It can be shown that the identification conditions for
general path-specific effects are much more stringent
than those of the direct and indirect effects. The path­
specific effect shown in Figure 3, for example, is not
identified even in Markovian models. Since direct and
indirect effects are special cases of path-specific effects,
the identification conditions of Theorems 2 and 3 raise
the interesting question of whether a simple character­
ization exists of the class of subgraphs, g, whose path­
specific effects are identifiable in Markovian models. I
hope inquisitive readers will be able to solve this open
problem.

Conclusions

This paper formulates a new definition of path-specific
effects that is based on path switching, instead of vari­
able fixing, and that extends the interpretation and
evaluation of direct and indirect effects to nonlinear
models. It is shown that, in nonparametric models,
direct and indirect effects can be estimated consis­
tently from both experimental and nonexperimental
data, provided certain conditions hold in the causal
diagram. Markovian models always satisfy these con­
ditions. Using the new definition, the paper provides
an operational interpretation of indirect effects, the
policy significance of which was deemed enigmatic in
recent literature.
On the conceptual front, the paper uncovers a class
of nonstandard policy questions that cannot be for-

420

PEARL

mulated in the usual variable-fixing vocabulary and
that can be evaluated, nevertheless, using the notions
of direct and indirect effects.

These policy questions

concern redirecting the flow of influence in the system,
and generally involve the deactivation of existing in­
fluences among specific variables. The ubiquity and
manageabiligy of such questions in causal modeling
suggest that value-assignment manipulations, which
control the outputs of the causal mechanism in the
model, are less fundamental to the notion of causation
than input-selection manipulations, which control the
signals driving those mechanisms.
