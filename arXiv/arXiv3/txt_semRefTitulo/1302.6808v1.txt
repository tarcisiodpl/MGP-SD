We describe scoring metrics for learning
Bayesian networks from a combination of
user knowledge and statistical data. Previ­
ous work has concentrated on metrics for do­
mains containing only discrete variables, un­
der the assumption that data represents a
multinomial sample. In this paper, we ex­
tend this work, developing scoring metrics for
domains containing only continuous variables
under the assumption that continuous data is
sampled from a multivariate normal distribu­
tion. Our work extends traditional statistical
approaches for identifying vanishing regres­
sion coefficients in that we identify two im­
portant assumptions, called event equivalence
and parameter modularity, that when com­
bined allow the construction of prior distri­
butions for multivariate normal parameters
from a single prior Bayesian network speci­
fied by a user.

Introduction

1

Several researchers have examined methods for learn­
ing Bayesian networks from data, including Cooper
and Herskovits (1991,1992), Buntine (1991), Spiegel­
halter et a!. (1993), and Beckerman et a!. ( 1994)
( herein referred to as CH, Buntine, SDLC, and HGC,
respectively ) . These methods all have the same basic
components: a scoring metric and a search procedure.
The metric computes a score that is proportional to
the posterior probability of a network structure, given
data and a user's prior knowledge. The search proce­
dure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring
metric. These methods use the two components to
identify a network or set of networks with high rel­
ative posterior probabilities, and these networks are
then used to predict future events.

Previous work has concentrated on domains contain­
ing only discrete variables, under the assumption that
data is sampled from a multivariate discrete distribu­
tion. In this paper, we develop metrics for domains
containing only continuous variables, under the as­
sumption that continuous data is sampled from a mul­
tivariate normal ( Gaussian ) distribution. Previously,
when working with continuous variables, the standard
solution had been to transform each such variable Xi to
a discrete one by splitting its domain into several mu­
tually exclusive and exhaustive regions. Our metrics
eliminate the need for this transformation. In addi­
tion, our metrics have the advantage that they use the
low polynomial dimentionality of the parameter space
of a mulitivariate normal distribution, whereas their
discrete counterparts often require a parameter space
that is exponential in the number of domain variables.
Our work can be viewed as an extension of traditional
statistical approaches for identifying vanishing regres­
sion coefficients, such as those described in DeGroot
(1970, Chapter 11). In particular, we translate two
assumptions that we identified in HGC for domains
containing only discrete variables, called parameter
modularity and event equivalence, to domains contain­
ing continuous variables. The assumption of parame­
ter modularity, addresses the relationship among prior
distributions of parameters for different Bayesian­
network structures. The property of event equivalence
says that two Bayesian-network structures that repre­
sent the same set of independence assertions should
correspond to the same event and thus receive the
same score. We show that, when combined, these as­
sumptions allow the construction of reasonable prior
distributions for multivariate normal parameters from
a single prior Bayesian network specified by a user.
Our identification of event equivalence arises from a
subtle distinction between two types of Bayesian net­
works. The first type, called belief networks, repre­
sents only assertions of conditional independence and
dependence. The second type, called causal networks,
represents assertions of cause and effect as well as as­
sertions of independence and dependence. In this pa­
per, we argue that metrics for belief networks should
satisfy event equivalence, whereas metrics for causal

tribution. In this case, we write

Our score-equivalent metrics for belief networks are
similar to the metrics described by Dawid and Lau­
ritzen (1993), except that our metrics score directed
networks, whereas their metrics score undirected net­
works. In this paper, we concentrate on directed mod­
els rather than on undirected models, because we be­
lieve that users find the former easier to build and
interpret.
We note that much of the mathematics involved in our
derivations is borrowed from DeGroot's book, "Opti­
mal Statistical Decisions ," (1970).

Throughout this discussion , we consider a domain x

use p(ele) to denote the probability of a discrete event

A belief network is a pair (Bs, Bp ) where Bs is a
belief-network structure that encodes the assertions of

conditional independence in Equation 2, and Bp is a
set of pdfs corresponding to that structure. In partic­
ular, Bs is a directed acyclic graph such that (1) each
variable in U corresponds to a node in Bs, and (2)
the parepts of the node corresponding to x; are the
nodes corresponding to the variables in II;. (In the
remainder of this paper, we use x; to refer to both the
variable and its corresponding node in a graph.) As­
sociated with node x; in Bs are the pdfs p(x;III;,().
Bp is the union of these pdfs. Combining Equations 1
and 2, we see that any belief network for x uniquely
determines a joint pdf for x. That is,

A minimal belief network

is a belief network where
Equation 2 is violated if any arc is removed . Thus,
a minimal belief network represents both assertions of
independence and assertions of dependence.
Let us suppose that the joint probability density func­
tion for x is a multivariate (nonsingular) normal dis-

where m; is the unconditional mean of x;, v; is the
conditional variance of x; given values for x1, . . . , x;_r,
and b;j is a linear coefficient reflecting the strength of
the relationship between x; and Xj (e.g . , DeGroot, p.

55) .
Thus, we may interpret a multivariate normal
distribution as a belief network , where b;j
0 (j < i)
implies that xj is not a parent of x;. We call this spe­
cial form of a belief network a Gaussian belief network.
The name is adopted from Shachter and Kenley (1989)
who first described Gaussian influence diagrams.

::::

More formally, a Gaussian belief network is a pair
(Bs, Bp), where (1) Bs is a belief-network structure
containing nodes x1,
. , X11 and no arc from xj to x;
whenever b;j = 0, j < i, (2) Bp is the collection of
parameters m = (ml,····mn), v= {v 1, ...,vn}, and
{ b;j I j < i}, and (3) the joint distribution over i
is determined by Equations 3 and 4. Due to special
properties of nonsingular normal distributions, a min­
imal Gaussian belief network is one were there is an
arc from Xj to x; if and only if b;j ::j; 0 .

.

Given a multivariate normal density, we can generate a
Gaussian belief network, and vice versa. The uncondi­
tional means m are the same in both representations.
Shachter and Kenley (1989) describe the general trans­
formation from iJ and {b;j I i < j} of a given Gaus­
sian belief network G to the precision m atrix W of the
normal distribution represented by G. They use the
following recursive formula in which W(i) denotes the

i x i upper left submatrix of W, b; denotes the column
vector (b1,;, . . , b;-1,;) and bi denotes the transposed
vector b; (i.e. , the line vector (b1,1, . . , b;-t,i)):

The Gaussian-belief-network representation of a mul­
tivariate normal distribution is better suited to model
elicitation and understanding than is the standard rep­
resentation [Shachter and Kenley, 1 989]. To assess a
Gaussian belief network, the user needs to specify
(1) the unconditional mean of each variable x; (m; ) ,
(2) the relative importance of each parent Xj in de­
termining the values of its child x; ( b;j), and (3 ) a
conditional variance for x; given that its parents are
fixed ( v;). Equation 5 then det ermine s W. In con­
trast, when assessing a normal distribution directly,

one needs to guarantee that the assessed covariance
matrix is positive-definite-a task done by altering in
some ad hoc manner the correlations stated by the
user.

a database. Table 1 is an example of a database for
the three-node domain of the Gaussian belief network
shown in Figure 1.
Our scoring metrics are based on five assumptions, the

first of which is the following:

from a multivariate normal distribution with unknown

means m and unknown precision matrix w.

equivalent to stating that the database D is a random
sample from a Gaussian belief network with unknown
parameters, v, B = {b;j li < i}, m.

A

Bayesian measure of the goodness of a network
structure is its posterior probability given a database:

p(BsiD,�)

=

c p(BsiO p(DIBs,�)

where c = 1/p(DI�) = 1/I:;B p(Bsl�) p(DIBs,�) is
a normalization constant. Fo� even small domains,

however, there are too many network structures to sum
over in order to determine the constant. Therefore we

use

p(Bsl�) p(DIBs,e) = p(D,Bsl�)

as

our score.

Also problematic is our use of the term Bs as an ar­
gument of a probability. In particular, Bs is a belief­
network structure, not an event. Thus, we need a def­
inition of an event B'S that corresponds to structure
Bs (the superscript "e" stands for event). A natural
definition for this event is that B'} holds true iff the

database is a random sample from a minimal Gaussian
belief network with structure Bs -that is, iff for all
j < i, b;j 1- 0 if and only if there is an arc from xj to
x; in Bs. For example the event B'S corresponding to
the Gaussian belief network of Figure 1, is the event

{ h2

=

0,

b1a# 0, b2s# 0}.

This definition has the following desirable property.
When two belief-network structures represent the
same assertions of conditional independence, we say
that they are isomorphic. For example, in the three
variable domain {x1,x2,x3}, the network structures
x -+ x2 -+ x3 and x1 f- x2 -+ x3 represent the same
assertion: x1 and x3 are independent given x2. Given
the definition of B�, it can be shown that events B'}1
and

Bh

are equivalent if and only if the structures
and Bs2 are isomorphic. That is, the relation of
isomorphism induces an equivalence class on the set of
events B'g. We call this property event equivalence.

Bs1

There is a problem with the definition, however.
In particular, events corresponding to some non­
isomorphic network structures are not mutually ex-

238

elusive.

For example, in the four-variable domain
consider the structures x1 => B ¢::: X-t
x4, where B is the subnetwork struc­
ture x2 � xs, and x => B means that there is an
arc from x to both variables in B. The events corre­
sponding to these structures both include the situation
where x1 and x4 are marginally independent . Arbi­
trary overlaps between events can make scores difficult
to interpret and use. For example, the prediction of fu­
ture events by averaging over multiple models cannot
be justified. In our case, however, we can repair the
definition of B5 so as to make non-equivalent events
mutually exclusive, without affecting our mathemati­
cal results or the intuitive understanding of events by
the user. In particular , all overlaps will be of mea­
sure zero with respect to the events that create the
overlap . Thus, given a set of overlapping events, we
simply exclude the intersection from all but one of the
events. We note that this revised definition retains the
property of event equivalence.

Belief-network structures Bs1 and Bs2 are isomorphic
if and only if B51 = Bs2.
the score for network structure Bs is
an immediate consequence of the property
of event equivalence is score equivalence.
Because

The next assumption leads to such a conjugate distri­
bution. If all variables in a case are observed , we say
that the case is complete. If all cases in a database are
complete, we say that the database is complete.

that xl_, . . . , xl is a random sample from a multivari­

matrix W. Suppose that the prior joint distribution of
iii and W is the normal- Wishart distribution: the con­
ditional distribution of m given W is n(j10, vW) such
that v > 0, and the marginal distribution of W is a
Wishart distribution with a: > n- 1 degrees of freedom
and precision matrix To, denoted by w(a:, T0). Then
the posterior joint distribution of iii and W given xi,
i = 1, ... , l, is as follows: The conditional distribution
of m given w is a multivariate normal distribution
with mean vector j11 and a precision matrix ( v+ l) W,

Proposition 2 (Score Equivalence) The scores of
two isomorphic belief-network structures must be equal.

Given the property of event equivalence, we techni­
cally should score each belief- network-structure equiv­
alence class, rather than each belief-network struc­
ture. Nonetheless, users find it intuitive to work with
( i.e., construct and interpret ) belief networks. Conse­
quently, we continue our presentation in terms of belief
networks, keeping Proposition 2 in mind.
3.1

Complete Gaussian Belief Networks

We first derive p(D,B'};j�), assuming Bs is the struc­
ture of a complete Gaussian belief network. A com­
plete Gaussian belief network is one with no missing
edges. Applying the property of event equivalence, we
know that the event associated with any complete be­
lief network is the same; and we use B'!sc to denote
this event.
To motivate the derivation, consider the following ex­
pansion of p(DIBsc

From Equation 7, we see that v can be thought of
as being an equivalent sampl e size for m-that is, the
equivalent number of cases the user has seen, since he
was ignorant about m . When l new cases are seen, the
posterior mean is updated as a weighted average of the
prior mean computed based on v cases and the sample
mean based on l cases. Furthermore, if xi, ... , x-;. is a
random sample of n-dimensional random vectors from
a multivariate normal distribution for which the mean
vector is 0 and the n x n precision matrix is
then
xixi' has the Wishart distribution given in

a as the user's equivalent sample size for the precision
matrix To. Note that a must be at least the number
of variables in the domain. We address the assessment
of ilo and To in Section 3.4.

lowing assumption:
Assumption 3

The

distribu­
tion p( m, w IB�c 1 ,; ) is a normal- Wishart distribution
as given in Theorem 3.

From Equation 5, this assumption fixes the distribu­
tion p(1n, v,BIE.Sc,�). Nonetheless, we shall some­
times find it easier to specify the prior density in the
space of W, rather then in the space of parameters
describing a Gaussian belief network.
It is well know that, if

General Gaussian Belief Networks

We now consider an arbitrary Gaussian belief network
of

Es. To form a prior distribution for the parameters
Es, we make two additional assumptions:
Assumption 4 (Parameter Independence)

For every Gaussian belief network Bs' p(v, BIBS.,e)=

I17=1 p(v;,b�IB5,�).

We note that this assumption is consistent with As­
sumption 3, because if p(WIBsc, e) is a W ishart

distribution, then p( v, EIEsc,�), obtained from
p( WIEse' e) by using Equation 5 and the Jaco­
bian 8Wj8vB of this transformation , is equal to
rr=l p( Vj' �lEse e). The derivation of this claim is
1

given in the Appendix (Theorem 7).

x;
If
has the same parents in two Gaussian belief networks
Es1 and Es2, then p(v;,b:IEh,e) = p(v;,b:IB52,�).
Assumption 5 (Parameter Modularity)

Assumption 4 has been made in discrete contexts
by many researchers (e.g., CH, Buntine, SDLC, and
HGC) . Assumption 5 has also been made by these
same researchers, but HGC were the first researchers
to make the assumption explicit and to emphasize its
importance for generating prior distributions. Param­
eter modularity plays a similar important role in the
current development. In particular, this assumption ,
in conjunction with the property of event equivalence
and our previous assumptions allows us to determine
the joint prior distribution of the parameters m, ii', B
associated with any Gaussian network Es from the
joint density p(m , WIEse).
To see this fact , first note that, by the definition of the
event B5, p(m lv,E,B 5,�) = p(m iv,B,Bsc'�). The

latter distribution is determined by p(m iW,Esc,e),
which is given. Second , from Assumption 4, we ob-

p(v;,b:IB,S,�) fo r
each i. By Assumption 5, however, p(vi,b�\B8,()
is equal to p( Vj 1 b: I Bs,c'e) for any complete network
structure Es' where the parents of x; are the same as
c
are those in Es. By event equivalence and Assumption 4, we obtain p(v;, ��E�,c , �) from the given density
p(WIEsc'�).
tain

p(v,BIB�,e)

by determining

From Assumptions 1 through 5, we derive p(DIB5,e).
To do so, we need the following theorem whose proof
is provided in the Appendix.
Theorem 4 If p(ilm , W,

D, �) is a multivariate nor­
mal distribution, and p( m I w, D, B.S e) is a multi­
variate normal distribution with a precision matrix

vW, v > 0, then p(xdxt, ... , Xi-1, v, B, D, B�, �) =
p(x;III;, v;, b�, nx,n,, B�,, {), where Bs' is any network
where X; h as the same parents as in Bs I and nx;IT; is
the database D restricted to the variables in { x;} U II;.

By applying Theorem 4 to the first term of the right­
hand-side of Equation 15, and posterior parameter in­
dependence and posterior parameter modularity to the
second term, we obtain

p(x;Jxt, ... ,x;_t,D1, B5,0

In particul ar, this claim holds for any complete Gaus­
sian belief network Esc == Bs' in which II; and x;
appear before any other variables, and II; appears be­
fore x;.

Let Dt = { C1, . . . , Ct-1} and Ct be an instance of
x1, . .. , Xn· In the following derivation, we use x; and
II; to represent the instance of x; and II; in the lth
case. Theorem 4 yields,

Score Equivalence

In making the assumptions of parameter indepen­
dence and parameter modularity, we have-in effect­
specified the prior densities for the multinomial param­
eters in terms of the structure of a belief network. Con­
sequently, there is the possibility that this specification
violates the property of score equivalence. The follow­
ing theorem, however, demonstrates that our specifi­
cation implies score equivalence.

tures, then p(DJBh, E.) and p(DJB52, E.) as computed
by Equation 17 are equal.

Proof: In Heckerman et a!. (1994, Theorem 10), we
show that a belief network structure can be trans­
formed into an isomorphic structure by a series of arc
reversals, such that, whenever an arc from x; to Xj is
reversed, II; = IIj \ { x;}. Thus, our claim follows if we
can prove it for the case where Bs1 and Bs2 differ by
a single arc reversal with this restriction.
So, let Bs1 and Bs2 be two isomorphic network struc­
tures that differ only in the direction of the arc between
x; and Xj (say x;-+ Xj in B5t). Let R be the parents

Metrics for Gaussian Causal
Networks

People often have knowledge about the causal relation­
ships among variables in addition to knowledge about
conditional independence. Such causal knowledge is
stronger than is conditional-independence knowledge,
because it allows us to derive beliefs about a domain
after we intervene. Causal networks, described-for
example-by Spirtes et al. (1993), Pearl and Verma
(1991), and Beckerman and Shachter (1994) represent
such causal relationships among variables. In partic­
ular, a causal network for U is a belief network for
U, wherein it is asserted that each nonroot node x is
caused by its parents. The precise meaning of cause
and effect is not important for our discussion. The in­
terested reader should consult the previous references.
The event C.S is the same as that for a belief-network
structure, except that we also include in the event the
assertion that each nonroot node is caused by its par­
ents. Thus, in contrast to the case for belief networks,
it is not appropriate to require the properties of event
equivalence or score equivalence. For example, con­
sider a domain containing two variables x and y. Both
the causal network Cs1 where x points to y and the
causal network Cs2 where y points to x represent the
assertion that x and y are dependent. The network
Cs1 , however, in addition represents the assertion that
x causes y, whereas the network Cs2 represents the as­
sertion that y causes x. Thus, the events C.h are C.S2
are not equal. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that
these events-and the events associated with any two
different causal-network structures-are mutually ex­
clusive.
In principle, then, a user may assign a (possibly dif­
ferent) prior distribution to the parameters m, v, and
B to every complete Gaussian causal network, con­
strained only by the assumption of parameter mod­
ularity. The prior distributions for parameters of in­
complete networks would then be determined by pa­
rameter modularity. We call this general metric BG,
as it is a superset of the BGe metric. For practical rea­
sons, however, the assessment process should be con­
strained. One alternative is to use the BGe metric. A
more general alternative is to continue to use the prior
network to compute iio and To, but to allow equivalent
sample size to vary for different variables and different
parent sets of each variable. We call this metric the
BGp metric, where "p" stands for prior network.

Summary and Future Work

We have described metrics for learning belief networks
and causal networks from a combination of user knowl­
edge and statistical data for domains containing only
continuous variables. An important contribution has
been our elucidation of the property of event equiv­
alence and the assumption of parameter modularity.

We have shown that these properties, when combined,
allow a statistician to compute a reasonable prior dis­
tribution for the parameters of any Gaussian belief
network, given a single prior Gaussian belief network
provided by a user.

A legitimate concern with our approach is that the
multivariate model is too restrictive. In practice, when
this model is inappropriate, statisticians will typically
turn to a more general model where each continuous
variable conditioned on its parents is assumed to be
a mixture of multivariate normal distributions. In
Geiger and Beckerman (1994), we derive metrics for
domains containing both discrete and continuous vari­
ables, subject to the restriction that a domain can be
decomposed into disjoint sets of continuous variables
where each such set is conditioned by a set of dis­
crete variables. We note that this work, when com­
bined with approximation methods that handle miss­
ing data, provides a method for learning with multi­
variate mixtures.
In the discrete case, a complete network has one pa­
rameter for each instance of i. Consequently, it is easy
to overfit such a structure with data; and the met­
rics developed for discrete domains provide a means
by which we can avoid such overfitting. In the contin­
uous case, a complete network has only n + n( n- 1) /2
parameters. Thus, it is possible that the errors intro­
duced by our methods, arising from heuristic search in
an exponential space to find one or a handful of struc­
tures with high scores outweigh the benefits associated
with decreasing the degree of overfitting. We leave this
concern for future experimentation.
