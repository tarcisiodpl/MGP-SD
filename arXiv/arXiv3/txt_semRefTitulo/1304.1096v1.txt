In previous work [1, 2] we defined a mechanism for
performing probabilistic reasoning in influence dia­
grams using interval rather than point-valued proba­
bilities. In this paper we extend these procedures to
incorporate decision nodes and interval-valued value
functions in the diagram. We derive the procedures
for chance node removal ( calculating expected value)
and decision node removal ( optimization) in influ­
ence diagrams where lower bounds on probabilities
are stored at each chance node and interval bounds
are stored on the value function associated with the
diagram's value node. The output of the algorithm
are a set of admissible alternatives for each decision
variable and a set of bounds on expected value based
on the imprecision in the input. The procedure can
be viewed as an approximtion to a full n-dimensional
sensitivity analysis where n are the number of impre­
cise probability distributions in the input. We show
the transformations are optimal and sound. The per­
formance of the algorithm on an influence diagrams is
investigated and comparerd to an exact algorithm.

probability and utility assessments. Exact verifica­
tion of the sensitivity of recommendations to all pos­
sible combinations of imprecise inputs is extremely
costly from a computational perspective. The proce­
dure developed here reduces the computational cost
to that of solving an influence diagram once. In Sec­
tion 5 we explore the nature of this approximation
relative to an exact procedure.
An influence diagram I = (N, A) consists of
a set of nodes N and arcs A. The set of nodes
N = U U 1>U{V}, where U is a set of chance nodes,
1> is a set of decision nodes, and V is the single

a set of conditional probability distributions relat­
ing X's outcomes to those of its predecessors (IIx)
in the graph. Interval influence diagrams differ from
the standard influence diagram formalism in that we
specify lower hounds on the probability distributions
associated with each chance node. The lower bounds
are interpreted as follows: we admit any probability

paper we define operations of chance node removal
into the value node (corresponding to taking a con­
ditional expected value) and decision node removal
(corresponding to maximizing expected value). The
expected value is expressed in terms of a lower and
upper bound, expressing the imprecision in value for
each combination of predecessors. Processing of deci­
sion nodes will generate sets of decision alternatives
which are admissible based on the imprecision in the
input probabilities and values, in a manner analogous

We now present three theorems which provide the

operations (illustrated in Figures 2,2, and 4) are suf­
ficient to evaluate any diagram [5].

Theorem 1 provides a method of calculating new

an almost immediate consequence of Lemma 1 in [2).

mented and tested on a variety of influence diagrams.
In this section we describe some experiments on a par­

examine robustness and sensitivity of results. For the

purposes of this discussion, we have encoded the oil­
wildcatter's decision model as an influence diagram
( See Figure 6). The model has two decisions. The
node labelled TEST is the choice among alternative
geologic tests of the seismic structure in an area. No
test, a cheap test and a perfect test are the alterna­
tives. The other decision is whether or not to drill.
The arcs into the DRILL node indicate that the type
of test and its result will be available when deciding
whether or not to drill. TEST-RESULTS provides in­
formation about SEISMIC-STRUCTURE, which in
turn provides information about the AMOUNT-OF­
OIL.
One way to characterize the interval influence di­
agram (liD) approach described here is to compare
it to an exact approach to calculating the ramifica­
tions of interval inputs. The results labelled EXACT
below refer to calculating values and decision recom­
mendations for all combinations of the endpoints of
the input probability ranges. Tables 1 and 2 display
the impact of using a lower-bound inerval approach
when three different levels of imprecision are added
to the original diagram. Specifically, we examined
probability ranges4 of .01, .05 and .10 for three nodes
(AMOUNT-OF-OIL, SEISMIC-STRUCTURE, and
COST-OF-DRILLING) . The exact procedure con­
sisted of solving the network for optimal decisions for
each of 1296 possible configurations. The exact ex­
pected value ranges and admissible decision sets were
based on these runs.

For th is

study, we selected a IJUbeet of nodes in the diagram for analysis
and introduced this range into each distribution residing in the
node.

The primary decision is whether or not to
DRILL. Recall from the influence diagram that the
DRILL decision is conditioned on the type of test se­
lected and its result ( one of "NS", "OS", or "CS") .
Tabel 1 shows the admissible decisions for the the
various possible information states for the DRILL de­
cision, using interval influence diagrams and the ex­
act procedure. The liD and the EXACT procedures
provide identical sets of admissible decisions for this
variable, indicating for this decision liD is a perfect
approximation to the exact analysis in terms of deci­
sion recommendations.
For the TEST decision liD is a less than perfect
approximation. Table 2 shows that as soon as any
imprecision is introduced, the liD procedure is un­
able to distinguish among the alternatives for TEST.
At a .10 level of imprecision, the EXACT algorithm
cannot distinguish between the "none" and "cheap"
test options. The table also shows the intervals in ex­
pected value associated with each procedure at each
level of imprecision.
We can also use the liD procedure to explore the
sensitivity of results to imprecision in various sets of
chance nodes. For example, in Table 3 admissible de­
cision sets for the TEST decision have been generated
far probability range .05 for various subsets of the
nodes AMOUNT-OF-OIL, SEISMIC-STRUCTURE,
and COST-OF-DRILLING. The table indicates that
results are least sensitive to imprecision in condi­
tional probabilities for COST-OF-DRILLING. Sen­
sitivity of results to SEISMIC-STRUCTURE and
AMOUNT-OF-OIL are approximately equivalent ac­
cording to the table.

In this paper we have extended previous results in
interval values for influence diagrams to include deci­
sion making. While manipulation of belief has many
interesting technical properties, the importance of
varying the degree of precision in probabilities can
only be gauged by including values and decisions into
the analysis. This paper represents one step in that
direction.
