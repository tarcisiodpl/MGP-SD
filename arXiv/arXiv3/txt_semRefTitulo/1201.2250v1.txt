A “bucket brigade” architecture for a quantum random memory of N = 2n memory cells needs
n(n+5)/2 times of quantum manipulation on control circuit nodes per memory call. Here we propose
a scheme, in which only average n/2 times manipulation is required to accomplish a memory call.
This scheme may significantly decrease the time spent on a memory call and the average overall
error rate per memory call. A physical implementation scheme for storing an arbitrary state in a
selected memory cell followed by reading it out is discussed.

A random access memory (RAM) is a fundamental
computing device, in which information (bit) can be
stored in any memory cell and be read out at discretion
[1, 2]. A RAM is made up of an input address register, a
data register, an array of memory cells, and a controlling
circuit. A unique address is ascribed to each memory
cell. When the address of a memory cell is loaded into
the address register, the memory cell is selected and the
information in the data register can be stored in it or the
information of the cell can be read out to the data register. Like its classic counterpart, quantum random access
memory (QRAM) is the building block of large quantum computers. A QRAM is a RAM working in a way
with quantum characteristic: the address and data registers are comprised of qubits instead of bits, and every
node of the controlling circuit is composed of a quantum
P object. When the address state is in superposition,
Pi αi |xi i, the read-out operation gives the output state
i αi |qi i in the data register, where |qi i is the quantum information stored in the memory cell i associated
with the address |xi i. Quantum random access memories storing classic data can exponentially speed up the
pattern recognition [3–6], discrete logarithm [7, 8], and
quantum Fourier transform, and quantum searching on
a classical database [9]. A general QRAM is an indispensable for the performance of many algorithms, such
as quantum searching [10], element distinctness [11, 12],
collision finding [13], general NAND-tree evaluation [14],
and signal routing [15].
In a seminal paper [15, 16], Giovannetti et al. (GLM)
proposed a promising bucket-brigade architecture for
QRAMs, which exponentially reduce the requirements
for a memory call. However, in GLM scheme, n times
of quantum unitary transformations per memory call is
required to turn one quantum trit initialized in |waiti in
each node of the control circuit into |lef ti or |righti, and
all flying qubits including address qubit and bus qubit
can pass through an arbitrary node of the controlling cir-

cuit only if a successful quantum manipulation has been
performed on the trits, leading to the times of manipulations on the nodes Nc = n(n + 5)/2 per memory call for
2n memory cells, where n is the number of bits in the address register. Here we present a QRAM scheme, where
the quantum object in every node have only two possible
states |lef ti and |righti. On average the times of quantum manipulations on the nodes per memory call can be
reduced to Nc = n/2, significantly decreasing both the
decoherence rate and the time spent on a QRAM call.
A physical implementation for information storage and
read-out on a QRAM is presented.
The main idea is shown in Fig.1. The N memory cells
are positioned at the end of a bifurcation control circuit
with n = log2 N levels. At each node of the control circuit there is a qubit with two states |lef ti and |righti.
The state of the jth qubit in the address register controls
which route to follow when a signal arrives at a node in
the jth level of the circuit: if the node qubit is |0i, the left
path is chosen; if it is |1i, the right path is chosen. For
example, an address register |001i means that left at the
0th level, left at the next, and right at the second. Illuminated by a control laser pulse a node qubit in state |lef ti
will flip to |righti if the incoming address qubit is |1i, or
remain in |lef ti if the address qubit is |0i. Without the
control pulse, a node qubit in |lef ti (|righti)will deviate
any incoming signal along the left(right) side route.
First, all the node qubits are initialized in state |lef ti.
Then the first qubit of the address register is dispatched
through the circuit. At the first node, the address qubit
incurs a unitary transformation U on the node qubit with
the help of a control pulse Ω(t): U |0i|lef ti = |0i|lef ti
and U |1i|lef ti = |0i|righti. Next the second qubit of the
address register is dispatched through the circuit, follow
left or right route relying on the state of the first node
qubit, and arrives at one of the two nodes on the second level of the circuit. The node qubit illuminated by
the control pulse will make a corresponding state change

2
according to the state of the second address qubit, and
so on. Note that the ith control pulse Ω(t) address all
the nodes of the ith level control circuit simultaneously.
After all the n qubits of the address register have gone
through the whole circuit, a unique path of n qubits has
been singled out from the circuit (see Fig.1). Subsequently, a single photon is sent along the selected path
to single out a memory cell. After that an arbitrary unknown state in the data register can be transferred to
the selected memory cell along the selected path, or the
state of the selected memory cell can be read out to the
data register along the path with black squares in Fig.1.
Finally, all the node qubits are reset to |lef ti for a next
memory address.
Because the state of a node qubit |lef ti will not be affected by the control pulse illuminating should the qubit
of the address register be in state |0i, on average there
are n/2 node qubits will flip to |righti in each memory
call. This means that on average only n/2 times of control manipulations are really performed in each memory
call. As a result, the mean comprehensive error rate per
memory address is nǫ/2 = 12 log2 N ǫ with the assumed
error rate ǫ per node qubit flip event. In contrast, the
GLM scheme requires n times state flip for a memory
call. In addition, in the GLM scheme a photon may pass
through a node only when a control pulse is applied on
the quantum trit, resulting the overall times of quantum
manipulations on the quantum trits per memory call be
n(n + 5)2, which has included 2n times of manipulations
for a signal photon going to a memory cell and back to a
data register along a same selected path. Here a singlephoton can pass through a node without any quantum
manipulation, therefore the average times of quantum
manipulation really performed on node qubits per memory call is n/2. Thus this scheme may significantly decrease the average overall error rate and shorten the time
required for a memory call.
Now we discuss a physical implementation. The node
qubit is encode on an atom with level |lef ti, |righti, and
an intermediate state |ei (see Fig.2 A). The transition
between |lef ti and |ei is coupled to the evanescent fields
of modes a and b of of frequency ωc of a microtoroidal
resonator. State |righti is coupled to |ei by classical
control field Ω(t). A tapered fiber and the resonator are
assumed to be in critical coupling where the input photons of frequency ωp = ωc are all reflected back and the
forward flux in the fiber drops to zero when the atom
transition (|lef ti → |ei) is far detuned from the resonator
frequency ωc [17]. If the atomic transition (|righti → |ei)
is on resonant with the resonator, the input photons can
transmit the resonator and travel forward one by one
[18]. A single-photon can be coherently stored in the
atom initialized in |lef ti by applying the control pulse
Ω(t) simultaneous with the arrive of the photon which is
equally divided and incident from both sides of the tapered fiber simultaneously (see Fig.2) [19]. The photon
storage results in a state flip of the atom to |righti. If
no single-photon is contained in the incoming field, the

qubit in |righti(|lef ti) routes the approaching signals right

atom does not affected by the control pulse illuminating
and remains in |lef ti [19].
The switch function of a node qubit in a QRAM can be
realized as follows: first, the address qubit is encoded as
α|0ip +β|1ip with Fock state |nip (n = 0, 1) and arbitrary
unknown complex coefficients α and β; the first qubit of
the address register is sent out along the control circuit
and is coherently stored in the atom in the first node
by applying the control pulse Ω(t) simultaneous with the
arrival of the address qubit equally split and incident
from both sides of the tapered fiber simultaneously. This
storing process will incur a state flip of the node atom to
|righti if the address qubit is |1i, or make no change in
the atom state |lef ti if the address qubit is |0i. When
the second address qubit is sent out and meet the first
node, it will be reflected back and travel along the left
path by applying an optical circulator in one side of the
tapered fiber (see Fig.2 b) if the atom in the first node
is in |lef ti, or will transmit the resonator and go along
the right path if the atom is in |righti. When the second
address qubit arrive at one of the two nodes on the second
level, it will be coherently stored in the node atom and
left the atom in |lef ti or |righti dependent on the photon
number contained in the address qubit, and so on.
We assume that each quantum memory cell in the
memory array consists of a memory atom m and an ancillary atom a, which are confined in two harmonic traps
and positioned inside a high quality cavity (see Fig.3A).
The ancillary atom has a three-level structure: |gia is
coupled to |eia by the field of the cavity mode with
strength ga ; |sia is coupled to |eia by a classic control
field Ω1 (t), where the subscript a denotes an ancillary
atom. After a path to the memory array is singled out, a
single-photon is sent along the path to the selected memory cell. A control laser pulse Ω1 (t) is applied to the ancillary atoms initialized in state |gia at the moment when

(A) An address qubit consisting of zero or one photon is
split equally in counter-propagating directions and coherently
stored using an impedance-matched control field Ω(t), leading to a state flip of the atom conditioned on the photon
number. (B) By employing an optical circulator an photon
travels along a tapered fiber being in critical coupling to the
resonator will go along the left (right) path if the atom is in
state |lef ti(|righti).

the photon arrives at the memory cell, resulting a state
flip of atom a to |sia [20, 21]. To avoid to be involved
into the quantum operations aimed on the selected memory cell, the ancillary atoms non-selected are excited to a
stable state |tia by a π pulses on transition |gia → |tia .
Next we can do some quantum manipulations either to
save an arbitrary unknown quantum state in the selected
memory cell or to read out its content.
In the first place, we discuss how to save an arbitrary
unknown quantum state in the memory cell identified
by the address register. First, an initialization operation on the memory cell array is performed. This can
be realized as follows: atom a in state |sia is excited
to a Rydberg state |ria by two-photon stimulated Raman (TWSR) pulses [22]; TWSR pulses on the transition
|sim → |rim (in terms of the perturbed state ) of the
memory atoms are applied, resulting the selected memory atom being excited to |rim and immediately flipping
to the ground state |gim through spontaneous radiation
(see Fig.3B). In this way only the memory atom in the
selected memory cell is reset in state |gim , leaving the
content of the others unchanged, because the states |rim
of the non-selected memory atoms are off resonant with
the TWSR pulses due to the absence of the strong Rydberg dipole interactions [23]. The ancillary atom in Rydgerg |ria is brought to the ground state |gia by applying
a π pulse on its transition |ria → |gia .
Second, an arbitrary unknown state α|0ip + β|1ip with
Fock bases |nip (n = 0, 1) is transferred along the selected
path to the memory cells. On the arrival of the signal
a classic control pulse Ω2 (t) is applied on the ancillary
atoms initialized in the ground state |gia , leading to a
state map (α|0ip + β|1ip )|gia → |0ip (α|gia + β|sia ) [20,
21].
State α|gia + β|sia is then transferred to a memory
atom by employing the strong dipole interaction between

two Rydberg atoms [24, 25]. When both of the memory
atom and the ancillary atom are in Rydberg states, the
strong dipole interaction between them will couple their
motion, which is best described in the basis of normal
modes |jin (j = 0, 1, 2, ...). All the motion modes of the
atoms are initially cooled to near their ground state by
Raman sideband cooling on them [26].
Third, we drive a π pulse on transition on |gim → |rim
on memory atoms to excite the memory atoms from
state |gim to state |rim . Fourth, a π pulse on transition |gia → |ria |0in and a blue sideband (BSB) pulse
on transition |sia → |ria |1in are applied on the ancillary
atoms, leading to state
|ψi1 = α|ria |rim |0in + β|ria |rim |1in

(1)

for the selected memory cell (see Fig. 3bB) and state
|ψi2 = (αx |rim + βx |sim )|tia for other memory cells with
their initial states state αx |gim + βx |sim (see Fig.3C).
Here we have used the fact that the normal mode of
motion is shared by the memory atom and the ancillary atom, both of which are in Rydberg states. Fifth,
a π pulse on the transition |rim → |gim unperturbed by
the strong dipole interaction between two Rydberg atoms
is applied on the non-selected memory atoms to restore
them to their initial states αx |rim + βx |sim .
Sixth, a π pulse on transition |rim |1in → |r′ im |0in
illuminates the memory atoms, resulting a state mapping
|ψi1 → |ψi2 = α|ria |rim |0in + β|ria |r′ im |0in .

(2)

′

Seventh, two π pulses on |r im |0in → |si and |rim |0in →
|gim , respectively, are applied on the memory atom,
leading to an unitary transformation |ψi2 → |ψi3 =
(α|gim + β|sim )|ria ; the unknown state α|0i + β|1i has
been stored on the selected memory atom. Note that this
two pulses will not affect the states of the non-selected
memory atoms since the pulses is detuned from the transitions |r′ im → |sim and |rim → |gim , which are free
of the influence of strong dipole interaction between two
Rydberg atoms. Eighth, the ancillary atoms is restored
to the ground state |gia by a a π pulse on the transition
|ria → |gia (see Fig.3E), and the non-selected ancillary
atoms are restored to the ground state |gi for the next
memory call by flipping to a intermediate level with a
pulse and then falling to |gi through spontaneous radiation. In this way an arbitrary unknown state can be
transferred to the selected memory atom, leaving the
states of other memory atoms unchanged.
Now we discuss how to read out the content of the selected memory atom αx |gim + βx |sim . First, a π pulse
on transition |sia → |ria is employed to excite the selected ancillary atom to state |ria . Second, we employ two π pulses on transition |gim → |rim |0in and
|sim → |rim |1in , respectively (see Fig.3F), driving the
system of the selected atoms m and a into state
|ψi4 = αx |rim |ria |0in + βx |rim |ria |1in .

(3)

Third, a π pulse on transition |ria |1in → |r′ ia |0in
drive the selected system into state |rim (αx |ria +

4
$

βx |r′ ia )|0in (see Fig.3G). Fourth, the selected memory
atom is sent to the ground state by a π pulse on the
transition |rim |0in → |gim . Fifth, two pulses on the
transition |ria → |gia and |r′ ia → |sia , respectively, set
the selected ancillary atom in state αx |gia + βx |sia (see
Fig.3H); the content of the select memory atom is transferred to the ancillary atom. Note that these pulses do

not influence the non-selected atoms a and m because
they have no strong dipole interaction. By applying a
classical impedance-matched control field Ω(t), a matterphoton mapping (αx |gia + βx |sia )|0ip → |gia (αx |0ip +
βx |1ip ) can be accomplished [20, 21], transferring the
state of the selected memory cell to the flying qubit and
leaving the ancillary atom in state |gia . The flying qubit
goes along the path with black squares to the data register (see Fig.1). Finally, the non-selected ancillary atoms
are initialized to state |gia for a next task.
In summary, we have presented a scheme for a quantum random access memory. With three-level memory
system been substituted by a qubit in every node of the
control circuit, this structure may significantly reduce
overall error rate per memory address and the memory
address time. In addition, we have discussed a physical implementation based on microtoroidal resonator and
strong-dipole interaction between two Rydberg atoms for
a QRAM writing and read-out. The microtoroidal resonator and the tapered fiber may be replaced by a surface plasmon propagating on the surface of a nanowireconductor-dielectric interface [27, 28].
