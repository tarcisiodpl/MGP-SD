Belief nets and Dirichlet distributions

We encode the joint distribution of a vector of discrete ran­
dom variables X = (Xv}vEV as a belief net (aka Bayesian
network, probability net). A belief net (V, A, 8) is a
directed acyclic graph whose nodes V index the random
variables and whose arcs A represent dependencies. Let
Pa(v) C V be the immediate parents of node v, and let
Fv = (Xw)wEPa(v) be the corresponding vector of parent
variables. In a belief net, a variable Xv is independent of
its nondescendents, given Fv. The elements of the vector
8 are the CPtable entries

Let Xv and Fv = TiwEPa(v)Xw be the domains of Xv and
Fv· We assume that the domains are finite. The CPtable
for Xv contains IXvl X IFvl entries 0v,xJf·
Figure 1 provides a simple example of a belief network
with specific CPtable entries. Here X1 has no parents, so
we write F1 = (}.We have F2 :::��: {Xt), Fa= (Xt), F 4 =
{X2, Xa); and for each value a, b, c, d, we have 01,al0 =
Pr{ xl = a IE>}, e2,bJa = Pr{ x2 = b I Xt = a, E> },
and e4,djb,c = Pr { x4 = d I x2 = b, X a = c, e }.

(Hence, using Figure 1, we have 81,110 = 0.4.) Note that
the values in each row add up to 1. In general, the variables
need not be binary, but can have larger (finite) domains.
The CPtable entries are estimated using training data and
(possibly) expert opinion. The latter information is incor­
porated using the Bayesian paradigm, where 8 is mod­
eled as a random variable and expert opinion is expressed
through an a priori distribution for 8. We adopt indepen­
dent Dirichlet priors1 for the various CPtable rows. Specit1cally, let 8vl/ = (9v,zl/)xEX. denote the CPtable row for
Fv = f- e.g., e4J(1,0) = (04,1](1,0), 04,0](1,0}) denotes
the entries for the X4 variable associated with the parental
assignment X2 = 1 and X3 = 0. We assume that, be­
fore observing the training data, the evil are independent
"Dir( a::,,11, x E Xv )"random vectors, where a:;,,11 > 0.
An absence of expert opinion is often expressed by setting
a;,xlf = 1 for all (v,x, f)- e.g., 84J(1,o) ""Dir( I, 1)
- which yields a uniform (flat) prior. Stronger opinion is
expressed through larger values of a:*v,x 11. Expressions for
the mean and variance of a Dirichlet distribution are given
below.
Now suppose that the training data consist of m indepen­
dent replicates of vectors X, generated using the given
structure and a fixed set of CPtable entries e. Let
mv,xlf denote the number of cases in the training set with
(Xv, Fv) = (x, f). Under the posterior distribution (the
conditional distribution given the training data), the E> vlf
are independent Vir( O:v,zl/• x E Xv) random vectors, with
O:v,xlf = a;,xlf + m v,xlf [BFH95]. This posterior distri­
bution underlies our derivation of Bayesian credible inter­
vals. Several properties of the Dirichlet distribution will be
needed.
Setting O:v,.J/ = l::xEXv O:v,xJ f• the posterior means and
(co)variances for CPtable entries are [BFH95]:

The extended paper [VGHOl] describes an algorithm for

We observe that

totically normal. This result follows from the asymptotic
multivariate normality of the components of 8 (after suit­
able standardization- see Section 2), and the fact that D
0
is a linear function ofEl.

[VGHOl] also provides additional comments on the proper
interpretation and application of this theorem.

There are exceptional situations where
the posterior distribution of q(9) is analytically tractable
and exact credible intervals are available. In the degener­
ate situation where the network structure has arcs connect­
ing all pairs of nodes (and hence imposes no assumptions
about conditional independence), the assumption of inde­
pendent Dirichlet distributions for CPtable rows is equiva­
lent to an assumption of a single Dirichlet distribution over
unconditional probabilities Pr{ Xv = Xv, v E V}. It is
then straightforward to derive the distribution of the query
probability using properties of the Dirichlet distribution;
see [Mus93].2 Note that this exact approach is not cor­
rect in general
i.e., it does not hold for networks with
non-trivial structure.3

Degenerate Case:

-

The computational problem of
computing J.LQ = q(p,) is known to be NP-hard [Coo90];
when all variables Xv are binary, the most effective ex­
act algorithms require time O(n2w), where n = lVI is the
number of nodes and w is the induced tree width of the
graph [Dec98, LS99]. The variance uq can also be com­
puted in time O(n2w). This result follows from the exis­
tence of algorithms that can compute all of the derivatives
Computational Issues:

Assuming a uniform prior and a sample of size m, we can
compute the posterior variance of Pr{ HIE} as P{HIE} x (1F{HIE} )/((m x P{E})+3), where F(x) is the expected value
of x, wrt the given belief net.
3This follows from a dimensionality argument: in a non-trivial
structure, the 2n-dimensional vector of unconditional probabili­
ties is constrained to lie in a lower-dimensional submanifold of
t e 2n -!-dimensional simplex. This cannot be represented by a
smgle Dirichlet distribution because, wpl, the constraints would
not be satisfied.

Figure 2(B) uses a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to address
the validity of the normality assumption, independently of

by our Monte Carlo simulation, plotted against standard

corresponding to a single query in { Q1, . .. , Q6}, given a
sample of size m 10. A straight-line would correspond
to data produced by a "perfect" normal distribution; we see
each dataset is close. (Of course, this is only suggestive; the
real proof comes first from Theorem 1, and then from the
data (e.g., Table 2) which demonstrates that our approach,
which assumes normality, produces reasonable results.)

Results for Alarm Network

The Alarm network [BSCC89] is a benchmark network
based on a medical diagnosis domain, commonly used in
belief network studies. The network variables are all dis­
crete, but many range over 3 or more values. The network
includes a CPtable for each node; i.e., a particular 0 is spec­
ified.
Table 3 summarizes the results for experiments on the
Alarm network, where we varied both J and m. For each
m, we generated a single random sample of size m from
0, and used this to determine a posterior distribution (as­
suming a uniform prior). Validity estimates were obtained
by averaging over randomly chosen queries. The queries
Pr{H =hIE= e, 0} were chosen by determining an as­
signment H = h to one randomly chosen query variable,
and assignments E = e to five randomly chosen evidence
variables. (Here, we used [HC91] to determine which vari-

Results for Random Networks

Although random networks tend not to reflect typical (or
natural) domains, they complement more focussed studies
by exposing methods to a wide range of inputs and help to
support claims of generality. We carried out experiments
on networks with 10 binary variables and 20 links, gener­
ating gold models from a uniform prior distribution on e.
and generating random queries of various types. Here we
used sample size m = 1 00 throughout, and varied the type
of query. Table 4 displays the results of our experiments.
Each query was of the form Pr{H =hIE= e, 9}, with
varying dimensionalities forE and H. Let #E and #H
denote the number of variables comprising E and H, re­
spectively. Each cell of Table 4 is based on 100 trials: I 0
queries on 10 networks, with both structure and posterior
generated randomly.

Discussion

Our hypothesis was that our Bayesian error-bars algorithm
would be accurate for essentially all cases. We tried to falsify our hypothesis by varying the following experimental
factors:
•

Network structure (V, A)

•

Credibility level 1

•

Query type (Diamond network, Alarm)

•

Number of evidence variables (Random networks)

•

Number of query variables (Random networks)

exceeded 20%. In most cases, the validity estimate was less
than 8/3. As noted in Table 1, even if our error-bars were
exact, we would still get positive validity estimates due to
the variance in to about �- We therefore believe that these
results comfortably bound the expected error of our method
under the experimental conditions . None of the factors that
we manipulated had a profound effect. T he strongest ef­
fect, observed in Table 4, was that increasing the number
of variables assigned in a query tended to increase the er­
ror I� 81; see also [Kle96]. One possible explanation is
that, as #E and #H increase, the query function q tends
to become more complex, and the local linear approxima­
tion of q becomes less reliable. Another possibility is that

Contributions:
Many real-world systems work by rea­
soning probabilistically, based on a given belief net modeL
When knowledge concerning model parameters is condi­
tioned on a random training sample, it is useful to view
the parameters as random variables; this characterizes our
uncertainty concerning the responses generated to specific
queries in terms of random variation. Bayesian error-bars
provide a useful summary of our current knowledge about
questions of interest, and so provide valuable guidance for
decision-making or learning.

This paper addresses the challenge of computing the error­
bars around a belief net's response to a query, from a
Bayesian perspective. We first motivated and formally de­
fined this task- finding the 100(1 - o)% credible interval
for a query response with respect to its posterior distribu­
tion, conditioned on a training sample. We then investi­
gated an application of the "Delta method" to derive these
intervals. This required determining both the covariance
matrix interrelating all of the parameters, and the derivative
of the query response with respect to each parameter. We
produced an effective system that computes these quanti­
ties, and then combines them to produce the error-bars.
The fact that our approximation is guaranteed to be cor­
rect in the limit does not mean it will work well in practice.
We therefore empirically investigated these claims, by test­
ing our system across a variety of different belief nets and
queries, and over a range of sample sizes and credibility
levels. We found that the method works well throughout.
