INTRODUCTION

Dempster's rule is the cornerstone of Dempster-Shafer
Theory, the theory of uncertainty developed by Shafer
[76a] from the work of Dempster [67]. The rule is used
to combine the representations of a number of inde­
pendent evidences, to achieve a combined measure of
belief. For the theory to be able give meaningful con­
clusions, it is essential that Dempster's rule is con­
vincingly justified. The rule and its justifications have
been criticised from many angles, a common criticism
being that it can be hard to know when evidences are
independent, and indeed, what 'independence' means
here.
In this paper an axiomatic approach to the combina­
tion of belief functions is taken. The concept of a com­
bination rule is formulated precisely, and assumptions
are made which determine a unique rule, Dempster's
rule. A benefit of this approach is that it makes the in­
dependence or irrelevance assumptions explicit. Since
the assumptions are arguably reasonable this gives a
justification of the rule. This justification is quite dif­
ferent from previous justifications of the complete rule,
though it is related to the justification in [Wilson, 89,
92c] of Dempster's rule for a collection of simple sup­
port functions.
In section 2, the mathematical framework is intro­
duced; in section 3, the concept of a combination rule is
defined; section 4 discusses Dempster's rule and some

of the problems with previous justifications of the rule;
section 5 defines Bayesian conditioning, used for rep­
resenting one of the assumptions; the assumptions on
rules of combination are defined and discussed in sec­
tion 6, and the main result of the paper, that they
determine Dempster's rule, is given.

SOURCE STRUCTURESAND
BELIEF FUNCTIONS

In this section the basic concepts are introduced. The
mathematical framework is essentially that of [Demp­
ster, 67] with different notation (and minor differences)
but some fundamental issues are considered in greater
detail.
2.1

SOME BASIC CONCEPTS

We will be interested in sets of propositions and con­
sidering measures of belief over these.
Definition: Frame

A frame is defined to be a finite set1•
Without loss of generality, it will be assumed that
frames are subsets of the set of natural numbers,2 IN.
The intended interpretation of a frame is a set of mu­
tually exclusive and exhaustive propositions. Then the
set of subsets of a frame 0, written as 2°, is a boolean
algebra of propositions.
1'Frame' is an abbreviation for Shafer's term 'frame of
discernment' [Shafer, 76a]; [Dempster 67, 68] and [Shafer,
79] allow frames to be infinite; however the results here
only apply to finite frames of discernment.
2 Actually any other infinite set would do; this is just to
ensure that the collection of all multiple source structures
(defined later) is a set.

Definition: ( Additive) Probability Function

Let 0 be a frame. P is said to be a probability function
over 0 if P is a function from 2° to [ 0, 1] such that
(i) P(O) = 1, and (ii) (additivity) for all A, B � 0
such that An B = 0, P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B).
We are interested in the propositions in 2°, for frame
e. Dempster, in his key paper [Dempster, 67] consid­
ers a situation where we have a probability function
over a related frame 0 representing Bayesian beliefs.
Definition: Source Structure

A source structure3Sover frame e is a triple (0, P, I),
where n and e are frames (known as the underlying
frame and frame of interest respectively) P (known
as the underlying probability function) is a proba­
bility function over 0, and compatibility function I
(Dempster's multi-valued mapping) is a function from
0 to 2°. Furthermore, for w E 0, if I(w) :::: 0, then
P(w) == 0.
The interpretation ofSis as follows. The set of propo­
sitions we are interested in is 2°, but we have no un­
certain information directly about e. Instead we have
a subjective additive measure of belief P over 0, and a
logical connection between the frames given by I: we
know that, for w E 0, if w is true, then I(w) is also
true. Here it is assumed that P is made with knowl­
edge of I.
The reason for the last condition in the definition is
that if w is true then I(w) is true; however, if I(w) :::: 0
then, since 0 is the contradictory proposition, w cannot
be true, so must be assigned zero probability.
Since it is frame e that we are interested in, we need
to extend our uncertain information about 0 to 2°.
Associated with the source structure Sis a belief func­
tion and mass function over e (see [Shafer, 76a] for the
definitions of these terms) defined, for X � e by
m8 (X) =
L P(w)
wE!l:J(w)=X

Be18 (X) =

L

P(w).

wE!l:J(w)!";X

Bel8 is the extension of the uncertain information
given by P, via the compatibility function I, to the
frame e. It is viewed as a subjective measure of belief
over e, and is generally non-additive.

work, and focuses on belief functions (the lower prob­
abilities in Dempster's framework). The relationship
between Dempster's and Shafer's frameworks is fairly
straight-forward, but for clarity the connection will be
described here. Although this paper deals primarily
with source structures, and justifies Dempster's rule
within Dempster's framework, these results also ap­
ply to Shafer's framework, using the correspondence
between the two.
Proposition

Function Bel : 2° --> [ 0, 1] is a belief function if and
only if there exists a source structure S over e with
Bel8 = Bel.
Each belieffunction has a unique associated mass func­
tion, and vice versa. The focal elements of a belief
function are the subsets of the frame which have non­
zero mass. Let us define the focal elements of a source
structureS= (0, P, I) over e to be the subsets A of e
such that I(w) ==A for some wE 0 such that P(w)#O.
It can easily be seen that the set of focal elements of
S is the same as the set of focal elements of Bel8.
From any belief function Bel, one can generate a source
structure by letting 0 be a set in 1-1 correspondence
with the set of focal elements, and defining the under­
lying probability function and compatibility function
in the obvious way.
Though the underlying frame may be more abstract
than the frame of interest, the natural occurrences of
belief functions generally seem to have an intrinsic un­
derlying frame. Even Shafer, who in his book does
away with the underlying frame, uses a Dempster-type
framework in later work, for example in his random
codes justification of Dempster's rule.
2.3

It is assumed here that all the source structures we
are interested in combining are over the same frame.
This is not really a restriction since if they are over
different frames, we can take a common refinement e
of all the frames (see [Shafer, 76a, chapter 6]). All the
source structures can then be re-expressed as source
structures over e' and we can proceed as before.

2.2

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
SOURCE STRUCTURES AND BELIEF
FUNCTIONS

In his book, a mathematical theory of of evidence
[Shafer, 76a], Shafer re-interprets Dempster's frame3See also 'Dempster spaces' in [Hajek et al., 9'2).

EXTENSION TO DIFFERENT
FRAMES OF INTEREST

COMBINATION RULES

Crucial to Shafer's and Dempster's theories is combi­
nation of belief functions/source structures. The idea
is that the body of evidence is broken up into small,
(intuitively) independent pieces, the impact of each
individual piece of evidence is represented by a belief
function, and the impact of the whole body of evidence

The Assumptions Behind Demp ster's Rule

is calculated by combining these belief functions using
Dempster's rule.
Informally, a combination rule is a mapping which
takes a collection of source structures and gives a
source structure, which is intended to represent the
combined effect of the collection; the combined mea­
sures of belief in propositions of interest can then be
calculated. If possible we would like to make natural
assumptions that determine a uniquely sensible com­
bination rule.
3.1

COMBINING SOURCE STRUCTURES

First a collection of source structures must be for­
mally represented. This is done using a multiple source
structure.
Definition: Jl4ultiple Source Structures

A multiple source structure s over frame 0 is defined
to be a function with finite domain '1/J" C IN, which
maps each i E '1/J" to a source structure over 0; we
write s(i) as the triple (Qi, Pi, I!).
There are some collections of source structures that
give inconsistent information. This leads to the fol­
lowing definition, which is justified in section 6.
Definition: Combinable

Multiple source structures (over some frame) is said to
be combinable if there exist Wi En: (for each i E '1/J")
with P:(w;):f:O and niE'I/I' If(w;):f:0.
Definition: Combination Rule

(i) The Underlying Fl.·ame

Let us interpret element w E n· as meaning that Wi is
true for all i E ,p•. n• is exhaustive, since each Qi is
exhaustive, and every combination is considered; the
elements of n• are mutually exclusive since any two
different ws differ in at least one co-ordinate i, and the
elements of Of are mutually exclusive. Therefore we
can use n• as the underlying frame for the combina­
tion. (Some of the elements of the product space may
well be known to be impossible, using the compatibil­
ity functions, so a smaller underlying frame could be
used, but this makes essentially no difference).
(ii) The Combined Compatibility Function

For w E n•) if w is true, then Wi (E nn is true for
each i E ¢•, which implies It (w;) is true for each i, so
nie..P· It is true (since intersection of sets in 2e corre­
sponds to conjunction of propositions). Assuming we
have no other information about dependencies between
underlying frames, this is the strongest proposition we
can deduce from w. Thus compatibility functions It
generate compatibility function I" on n·.
(iii) The Combined Underlying Probability
Function

This is the hard part of the combination rule so it is
convenient to consider this part on its own, defining
a C-rule to be the third component of a combination
rule.
Definition: C-rule

Let C be the set of all combinable multiple source
structures (over any frames). A combination rule II
is defined to be a function with domain C such that,
for sEC over frame 0, II(s) is a source structure over
e.

3.2

529

THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF
A COMBINATION RULE

A C-rule 1r is defined to be a function, with domain the
set of all combinable multiple source structures, which
acts on a combinable multiple source structure s over
some frame 0 and produces an additive probability
function over Q$. We write the probability function
1r ( s ) as 1!'3•

It turns out that there are easy, natural choices for two
of the three components of a combination rule, . the two
logical components.

(i) ns is defined to be niE.P' n:. An element w of n·

DEMPSTER'S RULE OF
COMBINATION4

4This refers to the rule described in [Shafer, 76a] and
the combination rule in [Dempster, 67), not the amended
non-normalised version of the rule, suggested in [Smets,
88), which is sometimes, confusingly, also referred to as
'Dempster's rule'.

DEMPSTER'S COMBINATION RULE
AND C-RULE

Definition: the Dempster C-rule

The Dempster C-rule 7rDs is defined as follows. For
combinable multiple source structure s, and w E 06, if
P(w) = 0 then 7riJ8(w) = 0, else
7r.b8(w)

=

K

IT P:(wi),

iE1fJ•

where K is a constant (i.e., independent of w) chosen
such that 7riJ8(n•) = 1 (as it must for 7rvs to be a
probability function).
Definition: the Dempster Combination Rule

The Dempster Combination Rule acts on multi­
ple source structure s to give source structure
(06' 7rns• J6).
It is easy to see that this is the combination rule used
in [Dempster, 67] and corresponds to 'Dempster's rule'
in (Shafer, 76a].
Justification of Dempster's rule therefore amounts to
justifying the Dempster C-rule 7rDS·
In section 6 the Dempster C-rule is justified by consid­
ering a set of constraints and assumptions on C-rules
that determine a unique C-rule.
4.2

DISCUSSION OF JUSTIFICATIONS
OF DEMPSTER'S RULE

Dempster's explanation of his rule in (Dempster, 67]
amounts to assuming independence (so that for any
w E 06' the propositions represented by Wj for i E 1/J'
are considered to be independent) thus generating the
product probability function P(w) == TiiE1fJ• Pi(wi), for
w E n•. If I' ( w) is empty then w cannot be true, so P
is then conditioned on the set {w : J'(w)¥:0}, leading
to Dempster's rule.
This two stage process. of firstly assuming indepen­
dence, and then conditioning on I'(w) being non­
empty, needs to be justified. The information given
by J• is a dependence between Wi for i E 1/;6, so they
clearly should not be assumed to be independent if this
dependence is known. Ruspini's justification [Ruspini,
87] also appears not to deal satisfactorily with this
crucial point.
A major weakness of a mathematical theory of evidence
is that the numerical measures of belief are not given a
clear interpretation, and Dempster's rule is not prop­
erly justified. This is rectified in (Shafer, 81] with his
random codes canonical examples.

Shafer's Random Codes Canonical Examples

Here the underlying frame n is a set of codes. An
agent randomly picks a particular code w with chance
P(w) and this code is used to encode a true statement,
which is represented by a subset of some frame e. We
know the set of codes and the chances of each being
picked, but not the particular code picked, so when we
receive the encoded message we decode it with each
code w' E n in turn to yield a message J(w') (which is
a subset of e for each w'). This situation corresponds
to a source structure (0, P, J) over e.
This leads to the desired two stage process: for if there
are a number of agents picking codes stochastically in­
dependently and encoding true (but possibly different)
messages then the probability distributions are (at this
stage) independent. Then if we receive all their mes­
sages and decode them we may find certain combina­
tions of codes are incompatible, leading to the second,
conditioning, stage.
To use Shafer's theory to represent a piece of evidence,
we choose the random codes canonical example (and
associated source structure) that is most closely anal­
ogous to that piece of evidence. Two pieces of ev­
idences are considered to be independent if we can
satisfactorily compare them to the picking of indepen­
dent random codes. However, in practice, it will often
be very hard to say whether our evidences are analo­
gous to random codes canonical examples, and judging
whether these random codes are independent may also
be very hard, especially if the comparison is a rather
vague one.5
Shafer's justification applies only when the underlying
probability function has meaning independently of the
compatibility function, that is, when the compatibil­
ity function is transitory (Shafer, 92] (see also [Wilson,
92b] for some discussion of this point). Many occur­
rences of belief functions are not of this form. The
justification given in this paper opens up the possibil­
ity of justifying Dempster's rule for other cases.
The Non-Normalised Version of Dempster's
Rule

The non-normalised version of Dempster's rule [Smets,
88, 92) is simpler mathematically so it is less hard
to find mathematical assumptions that determine it.
However, whether these assumptions are reasonable or
not is another matter. Smets considers that the un­
normalised rule applies when the frame is interpreted
as a set of mutually exclusive propositions which are
not known to be exhaustive. Such a frame can be rep­
resented by a conventional frame, by adding an extra
element representing the proposition which is true if
and only if all the other propositions (represented by
50ther criticisms of this justification are given in the
various comments on [Shafer, 82a, 82b], and in [Levi, 83].

The Assumptions Behind Demp ster's Rule

other elements of the frame) are false, thus restoring
exhaustivity. Therefore Smets' non-exhaustive frames
are unnecessary (and are restrictive).
Smets also attempts to justify (the normalised) Demp­
ster's rule using the unnormalised rule by 'closed-world
conditioning' [Smets, 88], i.e., combining the belief
functions as if the frame was not known to be exhaus­
tive, and then conditioning on the frame being exhaus­
tive after all. This suffers from a similar problem to
that faced by Dempster's justification (see above dis­
cussion), and seems very unsatisfactory: if we know
that the frame is exhaustive then this information
should be taken into account at the beginning (and
then Smets' justification does not apply)-pretending
temporarily that the frame is not exhaustive is per­
verse and liable to lead to unreliable results.

Definition: Product Subsets

Let s be a multiple source structure. A is said to
be a product subset of n• (with respect to s) if A=
TiiEtfJ• Ai for some 0;iAi � Of (iE ,P').
Note that such a representation, if it exists, is unique.
For product subset A of 03 and i E ,P', we will write
Ai as the projection of A into Of.
The following is a straight-forward extension of the
Bayesian conditioning of a source structure.
Definition: Bayesian Conditioning of a
Multiple Source Structure

Let s be a multiple source structure and let A be a
product subset of Q3 such that Pt(A;);iO for all iE 'lj;'.
Then the multiple source structure s� is defined as
follows: s� has domain '1/J$ and, for i E '1/J', s�(i) =
(s (i))�.

BAYESIAN CONDITIONING
6

In this section Bayesian conditioning of source
structures6 is defined; these are used to simply express
assumption (A) in section 6.
Definition: Bayesian Conditioning of a
Probability Function

Let P be an (additive) probability function over set
n, and let A � n be such that P(A);iO. Then the
probability function P � over A. is defined by
P�(f)=

P(f)
P(A)

for

r

� A.

This is used for conditioning on certain evidence A.
Note that if A is considered to be certain, and n is a
frame, then A is also a frame.
Definition: Bayesian Conditioning of a Source
Structure

Let S= (Q, P, I) be a source structure over frame 0
and let A � n (representing certain evidence) be such
that P(A);iO. Then s� is defined to be the source
structure (A, P �,I�), where I� is I restricted to A.
This should be uncontroversial, given that the judge­
ment of the underlying epistemic probability P is made
with knowledge of the compatibility function.
Incidentally if, for source structure S = (0, P, I) over
0 and A � 0, we let A = {wEn : I(w) � A}
then S� corresponds to geometric conditioning by A
[Shafer, 76b; Suppes and Zanotti, 77].
6This is not closely related to Bayesian updating of a
belieffunction [Kyburg, 87; Jatfray, 92]

CONSTRAINTS AND
ASSUMPTIONS ON C-RULES

In this section we introduce two clearly natural con­
straints on C-rules, and two arguably reasonable as­
sumptions. It is shown that together these determine
a unique C-rule, which turns out to be Dempster's C­
rule, hence justifying Dempster's rule.
Constraint: Respecting Contradictions

C-rule 1r is said to respect contradictions if for any
combinable multiple source structure s and w E n•, if
P(w) = 0 then 7r3(w)= 0.
If I' ( w) :::: 0 then w cannot be true since w true im­
plies J• (w) true, and 0 represents the contradictory
proposition. Therefore any sensible C-rule must re­
spect contradictions.
Constraint: Respecting Zero Probabilities

C-rule 1r is said to respect zero probabilities if for any
combinable multiple source structure s and w E 0', if
Pi (w;) = 0 for some iE '1/J', then 1!'1(w) = 0.
If Pf ( w;) = 0 for some i then w; is considered impossi­
ble (since frames are finite), so, since w is the conjunc­
tion of the propositions w;, w should clearly have zero

probability.

Note that if we missed out the condition that the mul­
tiple source structure had to be 'combinable' in these
two constraints and in the definition of a C-rule then
these two constraints are inconsistent: for any C-rule 1r
and any multiple source structure s which is not com­
binable, if 1r respects contradictions and zero proba-

532

bilities then 7r8(w) = 0 for any wE !.l", which is incon­
sistent with 1r8 being a probability function.
Definition

Let s be a multiple source structure, k E 1/J", and I E
!.lt. Then

Ei is defined to be {wE n• : w(k) =I}, and -.Ei is
defined to be {wE n• : w(k)fl}, i.e., !.l"\Ei. The set
Ei is the cylindrical extension in n• of I (E !.lt), and
can be thought of as expressing the event that variable
k takes the value l.
Definition: Assumption (A)

C-rule 1r is said to satisfy assumption (A) if 7r respects
zero probabilities and, for any combinable multiple
source structure s, for any k E 1/J", I E !.lt such that
7r8(.6.)f0, where .6. = -.EL,
(7r")a = 7r•a.
Note that since 7r respects zero probabilities, if
7r"(.6.)f0 then Pk(.6.k)f0, so s� is defined.
In fact it can be shown that if 7r satisfies assumption
(A) then it satisfies a more general form of the assump­
tion where .6. is allowed to be an arbitrary product
subset of n·.
Assumption (A) can be thought of as postulating that
Bayesian conditioning commutes with source structure
combination.
Bayesian conditioning by -.Ei can be viewed (roughly
speaking) as omitting the lth focal element from the
kth Belief function (and scaling up the other masses).
Assumption (A) amounts to saying that it should not
make any difference whether we omit that focal ele­
ment before, or after, combination.
Definition: Assumption (B)

Let s be a combinable multiple source structure such
that, for some kE 1/J",
lOti= 2 and lOti= 1 foriE 1/J" \ {k},
and l" (w)f0 for wE n•.
Then for IE !.lt,

The notation hides the simplicity of this assumption.
The multiple source structures referred to are of a very
simple kind: one of the component source structures
has just two elements in its underlying space, and so
leads to a belief function with at most two focal ele­
men�s, and all the other component source structures
give belief functions with just one focal element, so

they can be viewed as just propositions, i.e., certain
evidences; furthermore there is no conflict in the evi­
dences. In terms of belief functions this is the situation
where we are conditioning a belief function with two
masses by a subset of e.
Assumption (B) is just that adding all the other cer­
tain sources does not change the probabilities of com­
ponent k. The rationale behind this assumption is that
the certain evidences are not in conflict with the in­
formation summarised by the kth source structure, so
why should they change the probabilities?
Theorem

7rDS is the unique C-rule respecting contradictions,
zero probabilities and satisfying (A) and (B).
This means that Dempster's rule of combination
uniquely satisfies our constraints and assumptions,
hence justifying it.
Sketch of Proof

Unfortunately the proof of this theorem is far too long
to be included here. To give the reader some idea of
the structure of the proof, it will be briefly sketched.
It can easily be checked that 7rDS satisfies the con­
straints and assumptions. Conversely, let 7r be an ar­
bitrary C-rule satisfying the constraints and assump­
tions. First, it is shown that 7r satisfies a more gen­
eral form of (A), where .6. is allowed to be an arbi­
trary product subset of n•. This is then applied to
the case of .6. = {w, w '} where w and w' differ in only
one co-ordinate. In conjunction with assumption (B)
this enables us to show that, when the denominators
are non-zero,
1r"(w)
1r8(w')
.
7r_bs(w)
7r.bs(w ')
_

A source structure over e is said to be discounted
if e is a focal element of it, and a multiple source
structure is said to be discounted if each of the source
structures of which it is composed is discounted. It
is then shown that, for any discounted multiple source
structure s, 7r8 = 7r_b8, using the last result repeatedly.
The theorem is then proved by taking an arbitrary
combinable multiple source structure t, discounting it
to form s (see [Shafer, 76a]) and using the more general
form of assumption (A) again to relate 7rt and 7r8
7r.bs.
7

DISCUSSION

Both assumptions (A) and (B) seem fairly reasonable.
(A) appears to be an attractive property of a C-rule,
but is a rather strong one, and it is not currently clear
to me in which situations it should hold (it is conceiv­
able that there are other reasonable-seeming principles

The Assump tions Behind Dempster's Rule

with which it is sometimes in conflict). Further work
should attempt to clarify exactly when both assump­
tions are reasonable.
There are cases where Dempster's rule can seem un­
intuitive, for example, I argued in [Wilson, 92b] that
Dempster's rule is unreasonable at least for some in­
stances of Bayesian belief functions, and there has been
much criticism of certain examples of the use of the
rule e.g., [Pearl, 90a, 90b; Walley, 91; Voorbraak, 91;
Zadeh, 84]_7
If it does turn out that there are certain types of belief
functions where assumption (A) or (B) is not reason­
able, then the above theorem, as it stands, is not use­
ful. However, an examination of its proof reveals that
only two operations on belief functions/source struc­
tures are used-Bayesian conditioning (i.e, omitting
focal elements and scaling the others up) and discount­
ing (i.e, adding a focal element equal to the frame
e, and scaling the others down). This means that
the proof could be used to justify Dempster's rule for
any sub-class of belief functions/source structures (for
which (A) and (B) may be more reasonable) which is
closed under these operations, for example the set of
simple support functions or the set of consonant sup­
port functions. Also, for the same reason, the proof
could be used to justify Dempster's rule for collections
of belief functions/multiple source structures s such
that l3(w)-:j:.0 for all w E f23, if (A) and (B) were con­
sidered reasonable here.
It might also be interesting to investigate alternatives
to (B), which give different values for 11'3(Ek) than
those given in (B). The proof of the theorem can be
modified to show that there is at most one C-rule
satisfying the constraints and assumptions, though of
course it will not be the Dempster C-rule.
