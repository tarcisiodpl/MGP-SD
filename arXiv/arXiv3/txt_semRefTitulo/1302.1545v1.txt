W hen performing regression or classification,
we are interested in the conditional probabil­
ity distribution for an outcome or class vari­
able Y given a set of explanatory or input
variables X. We consider Bayesian models
for this task. In particular, we examine a spe­
cial class of models, which we call Bayesian
regression/classification (BRC) models, that
can be factored into independent conditional
(ylx) and input ( x ) models. These mod­
els are convenient, because the conditional
model (the portion of the full model that we
care about) can be analyzed by itself. We
examine the practice of transforming arbi­
trary Bayesian models to BRC models, and
argue that this practice is often inappropri­
ate because it ignores prior knowledge that
may be important for learning. In addition,
we examine Bayesian methods for learning
models from data. We discuss two criteria
for Bayesian model selection that are appro­
priate for repression/classification: one de­
scribed by Spiegelhalter et al. ( 1993), and an­
other by Buntine (1993). We contrast these
two criteria using the prequential framework
of Dawid (1984), and give sufficient condi­
tions under which the criteria agree.

Introduction

Most work on learning Bayesian networks from data
has concentrated on the determination of relationships
among a set of variables. This task, which we call Joint

analysis ,

has applications in causal discovery and the
prediction of a set of observations. Another important
task is regression/classification: the determination of
a conditional probability distribution for an outcome
or class variable Y given a set of explanatory or input
variables X. When Y has a finite number of states we
refer to the task as classification. Otherwise we refer
to the task as regression.
In this paper, we examine parametric models for the
regression/classification task. In Section 2, we exam­
ine a special class of models, which we call Bayesian re­
gression/classification (BRC) models, that can be fac­
tored into independent conditional (ylx) and input (x)
models. These models are convenient, because the con­
ditional model (the portion of the full model that we
care about) can be analyzed alone. In Section 3, we ex­
amine the practice of transforming arbitrary Bayesian
models to BRC models, and argue that this practice is
often inappropriate because it ignores prior knowledge
that may be important for learning.
Also in this paper, we discuss Bayesian methods for
learning models from data. In Section 4, we compare
Bayesian model averaging and model selection. In Sec­
tion 5, we discuss two criteria for Bayesian model selec­
tion that are appropriate for regression/ classification:
one described by Spiegelhalter et al. (1993), and an­
other by Buntine (1993). We contrast these two crite­
ria using the prequential framework of Dawid (1984),
and give sufficient conditions under which the criteria
agree.
The terminology and notation we need is as follows.
We denote a variable by an upper-case letter (e.g.,
X, Y, X;, 8), and the state or value of a correspond­
by that same letter in lower case (e.g.,
We denote a set of variables by a bold­
face upper-case letter (e.g. , X, Y, X;). We use a cor­
responding bold-face lower-case letter (e.g., x, y, x;)
to denote an assignment of state or value to each vari-

ing variable

able in a given set. VvTe say that variable set X is
in configuration x. We use p(X = xJY = y) (or
p(xly) as a shorthand) to denote the probability or
probability density that X = x g ive n Y
y. We
also use p(xjy) to denote the probability distribution
(both mass functions and density functions) for X
given Y = y. Whether p(xjy) refers to a probabil­
ity, a probability density, or a probability distribution
will be clear from context.

Regression/ Classification

In this section, we examine various parametric mod­
els for the task of regression/ classification. Mod­
els for this task are of two main types: conditional
models and joint models. A conditional model is
of the form p(yjx, em, m). A joint model is of the
form p(y, xJe m, m). We use a joint model for re­
gression/ classification by performing probabilistic in­
ference to obatin p(yjx, em' m).
Examples of joint models include Bayesian networks.
F igure la shows the structure of a naive Bayes model
in which the variables X are mutually independent
given Y. Suppose Y has r states y1 , ... , yr, each X;
is binary with states x} and xl, and each local distri­
bution function is a collection of multinomial distribu­
tions (one distribution for each parent configuration).
For this example, it is not difficult to derive the corre­
sponding conditional model (see, for example, Bishop,

This conditional model p(yix, em, m) is a type of
generalized linear model known as a linear softmax

regression. We can display the structure of this con­
ditional model as a Bayesian n etwork, as shown in Fig­
ure lb. In the figure, the input nodes X are shaded to
indicate that we observe them and hence do not care
about their joint distribution.
Now let us specialize our discussion to Bayesian mod­
els for regression/classification. In the Bayesian ap­
proach, we encode our uncertainty about Om and m
using probability distributions p(emlm) and p(m), re­
spectively. Thus, the Bayesian variant of a joint model
takes the form

p(y,x,em,m) =p(m) p(emjm) p(y,xJ8m,m)

(5)

We refer to this model as a Bayesian joint (BJ) model.
We define a Bayesian analogue to a conditional model
as follows. Suppose that em can be decomposed into
parameters (Bx, eYI x) such that

p(y,xJem,m) =p(xJBx,m) p(yjx,eyJx,m)

(6)

(7)
p(em Jm) = p(exJm) p(8yJxlm)
In this case, given data D = ((Yt,xt), ... ,(yN,XN)),
assumed to be a random sample from the true distri­
bution of Y and X, we have

p(em IY, x, m)

Discussion

Several researchers have demonstrated that Bayesian
networks for both the joint analysis and regres­
sion/ classification tasks provide better predictions
when local distribution functions are encoded with
a small number of parameters, as is the case with
the use of decision trees, decision graphs, and causal­
independence models (e.g., Friedman and Goldszmidt,
1996; Chickering et a!., 1997; Meek and Heckerman,
1997). Despite our theoretical objections to the use
of BERC models, they offer another parsimonious pa­
rameterization of local distribution functions, and may
lead to better predictions in practice. For example,
polynomial softmax regressions may be useful when
a node and its parents are discrete. Experiments are
needed to investigate these possibilities.
