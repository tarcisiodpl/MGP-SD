  In this paper some initial work towards a new approach to qualitative reasoning under un certainty is presented  This method is not only applicable to qualitative probabilistic reasoning  as is the case with other methods  but also allows the qualitative propagation within networks of values based upon possi bility theory and Dempster Shafer evidence theory  The method is applied to two simple networks from which a large class of directed graphs may be constructed  The results of this analysis are used to compare the quali tative behaviour of the three major quantita tive uncertainty handling formalisms  and to demonstrate that the qualitative integration of the formalisms is possible under certain as sumptions     INTRODUCTION  In the past few years  the use of reasoning about qual itative changes in probability to deal with uncertainty has become widely accepted  being applied to domains such as planning  Wellman     b  and generating plau sible explanations  Henrion and Druzdzel        Such a qualitative approach has certain advantages over quantitative methods  not least among which is the ability to model domains in which the relation between variables is uncertain as a result of incomplete knowl edge  and domains in which numerical representations are inappropriate  The existence of the latter  as Wellman      a  points out  is often due to the precision of numerical methods which can  in certain circumstances  lead to knowledge bases being applicable only in very narrow areas be cause of the interaction between values at a fine level of detail  Since they view the world at a higher level of abstraction  qualitative methods are immune to such  Current address  Advanced Computation Laboratory  Imperial Cancer Research Fund  P     Box      Lincoln s Inn Fields  London  WC A  PX  UK  problems  the small complications such interactions cause simply have no effect at the coarse level of detail with which qualitative methods are concerned  The focus of the qualitative approach of Wellman and Henrion and Druzdzel is assessing the impact of evi dence  That is assessing how the change in probabil ity of one event due to some piece of evidence affects the probability of other events  For instance  taking a patient s temperature and finding that it is   C is evidence that increases the probability that she has a fever  which in turn increases the probability that she has measles  Now  when using the qualitative method we reason with a restricted set of values  Instead of using the full range of real numbers we are only interested in whether values are positive      negative      zero      or any of the three      Thus we can determine that since the probability of fever increases  the change in prob ability is      and use this to decide that the change in probability of measles is also      This is clearly weaker information than that obtained by traditional methods but may still be useful  Wellman     a   in particular since qualitative results may be obtained in situations where no numerical information may be de duced     A NEW QUALITATIVE APPROACH  This paper presents a new approach to reasoning about qualitative changes  This work is drawn from the first author s thesis  Parsons       in which may be found a number of extensions to the work described here  The motivation behind this work was to integrate dif ferent approaches to reasoning under uncertainty  in particular probability  possibility  Zadeh        Dubois and Prade     a   and evidence  Shafer        Smets       theories  Thus  our qualitative approach differs from that described above in that it is concerned with changes in possibility values  Parsons     a  and belief values  Parsons     b  as well as probability values  As a result we need a general way of referring to values that may be probabilities  possibilities or beliefs         Parsons and Mamdani  Defini ti on      The certainty value of a variable X taking value x  val x   is either the probability of X  p x   the possibility of X  II x   or the belief in X  bel x    We set our work in the framework of singly connected networks in which the nodes represent variables of in terest  and the edges represent explicit dependencies between the variables  When the edges  of such graphs are quantified with conditional probability values they are similar to those studied by Pearl         when pos sibility values are used the graphs are similar to those of Fonck and Straszecka      J and when belief values are used the graphs are those studied by Smets       J   Each node in a graph represents a binary valued vari able  The probability values associated with a vari able X which has possible values x and X are p x  and p  x   and the possibility values associated with X are II x  and II x   Belief values may be assigned to any subset of the values of X  so it is possible to have up to three beliefs associated with X  bel  x    bel  x   and bel  x x    For simplicity these will be written as bel x   bel x  and bel x x   This rather restrictive framework is loosened in  Parsons     J where non binary values and multiply connected are considered   U  Wellman      a      bJ and Henrion and Druzdzel      J base their work upon the premise that a suitable interpretation of  a positively influences c  is that  p c a      p c a      This seems reasonable  but it is a premise  there are other ways of encoding the information that seem equally intuitively acceptable  for instance p c I a    p c  and p c I a   p c a   Dubois and Prade     J  Since our aim was to provide a method that was suit able for integrating formalisms we wanted to start from first principles thus minimising the number of neces sary assumptions  As a result  a different approach was adopted as described below   I  I  a change in  say  val a  affects val c  to propagate the effect of the evidence  We define the following relationships that describe how the value of a variable X changes when the value of a variable Y is altered by new evidence  Defini ti on      The certainty value of a variable X taking value x is said to follow the certainty value of variable Y taking value y  val x  follows val y   if val x  increases when val y  increases  and val x  decreases when val y  decreases  Defini ti on      The certainty value of a variable X taking value x is said to vary inversely with the cer tainty value of variable Y taking value y  val x  varies inversely with val y   if val x  decreases when val y  increases  and val x  increases when val y  decreases  Defini ti on      The certainty value of a variable X taking value x is said to be independent of the cer tainty value of variable Y taking value y  val x  is independent of val y   if val x  does not change as val y  increases and decreases   The way in which the variation of val x  with val y  is determined is by establishing the qualitative value of the derivative  val x   val y  that relates them  If the derivative is known  it is a simple matter to cal culate the change in val x  from the change in val y   Thus to determine the change at C in Figure   we have   val c    val c      val a      a  Bval a      EB  I  Given a link joining nodes A and C as in Figure    we are interested in the way in which a change in the value of a  say  expressed in a particular formalism  in fluences the value of c  Note that the arrow between A and C does not necessarily indicate a causal relation ship between them  rather it suggests that propagation of qualitative changes will be from A to C         A  c  Figure    A simple network We can then model the impact of evidence that affects the value of A in terms of the change in certainty value of a and a  relative to their value before the evidence was known  and use knowledge about the way that    val c        val a           val c    Bval a     a vai        val  c      val a     val a    EB       b   Bval a

val c  varies inversely with val a  when  val c   val a        and is independent of val a  when  val c   val a           QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN SIMPLE NETWORKS  Applying probability theory to the example of Figure    so that val x  becomes p x  in     and      and re ferring to the directed link joining A and C as A     C  we have the following simple result which agrees with the assumption     made by Wellman as a basis for his qualitative probabilistic networks when conditional values are taken as constant  as they are throughout this work  Theorem      The relation between p x  and p y  for the link A     C is such that p x  follows p y  iff p x I y    p x I   y   p x  varies inversely with p y  iff p x I y    p x I   y  and p x  is independent of p y  iff p x I y    p x I   y  for all for all x E  c    c   yE a   a   Proof  Probability theory tells us that p c    p a  p c I a    p   a p c I   a  and p a       p   a  so that p c    p a   p c I a    p c I   a     p cl  a  and   val c   val a J     p cla   p cl  a J  Similar rea soning about the way that p c  varies with p   a  and p   c  varies with p a  and p   a  gives the result D  By convention   Pearl    J two nodes A and C are not connected in a probabilistic network if p a I c   p a I   c    In addition  since p a  and p   a  are related by p a        p   a   we can say that if p c  follows p a   then p   c  varies inversely with p a  and follows p   a   The assumption that conditional probabilities are con stant does not seem to cause problems when propagat ing changes in singly connected networks as discussed here  However  the assumption does become problem atic when handling multiply connected networks   Par sons        Applying possibility theory to the network of Figure    and writing II x  for val x  in     and      we can establish a relationship between II a  and II c   Un fortunately  unlike the analogous expression for prob ability theory  this involves the non conditional value II a   This complicates the situation since the exact form of the qualitative relationship between II a  and II c  depends upon whether II a  is increasing or de creasing    e have        Theorem      The relation between II x  and II y   for all x E  c   c   y E  a   a   for the link A     C is such that II x  follows II y  if min II x I y  II y     min II x I   y  II   y   and II y    II x I y   If min II x I y   II y       min II x I   y  II   y   and II y    II x I y  then II x  may follow II y  up if II y  is increasing  and if min II x I y   II y    min  II x I   y   II   y   and II y   IT x I y  then II x  may follow II y  down if II y  is decreasing  Other wise II x  is independent of II y    Possibility theory gives II c   sup  min II c I a  II a   min  r c I   a  II   a      This may not be differentiated  but consider how a small change in II a  will affect II c   If II a  is the value that determines II c   any change in II a  will be reflected in II c   This must happen when min II c I a  II a     min II c I   a  II   a   and II a    II c I a   If II a  is increas ing and the second condition does not hold  it may become true at some point  and so the increase may be reflected in II c   Similar reasoning may be applied when II a  is decreasing and the first condition is ini tially false  Thus we can write down the conditions relating II c  and II a   while those relating II c  and II   a  as well as those relating II   c  and II a  and II   a  may be obtained the same way  D Proof   To formalise this we can say that   val c   val a      iJ if ii x  may follow II y  up and   val c   val a J    J if ii x  may follow II y  down while extending   to give       J  OJ   J   J    J   J  OJ   J   J   OJ  OJ  OJ  OJ  OJ    J   J  OJ   J        J   J  OJ   J   J   i J    OJ  OJ  OJ             OJ  OJ    OJ        where    OJ indicates a value that is either zero or positive  Normalisation  the possibilistic equivalent of p a     p   a   ensures that max II a   II   a       Thus at least one of II a  and II   a  is    and at most one of II a  and II   a  may change  so II x  changes when either II y  or II   y  changes  Writing bel x  for val x  in     and      and using Dempster s rule of combination   Shafer      J to com bine beliefs in the network of Figure    we have  Theorem      The relation between bel x  and bel y  for the link A     C is such that bel x  follows bel y  iff bel x I y    bel x I y U   y   bel x  varies inversely with bel y  iff bel x I y    bel x I y U   y  and bel x  is independent of bel y  iff bel x I y    bel x I y u  y  for all x E  c c   y E  a  a   Proof  By Dempster s rule bel c   La a   a  m a  bel c I a   Now  from Shafer       J m a    bel a   m   a   bel   a  and m au  a     bel a   bel   a   Thus  bel c   bel a

c I aU a  is the belief induced on cby the marginalisation on  c   c  of the joint belief on the space  c U c   a U a   Thus bel c  follows bel a  if cis more likely to occur given a than given the whole frame  Other results are possible when alternative rules of combination  such as Smets  disjunctive rule   Smets        are used  ilar reasoning about the way that and varies with gives the result     U  x  The results presented in this section allow the propa gation of changes in value from A to C given condi tionals of the form It is possible to derive similar results for propagation from C to A  Parsons which say  for instance  that if follows then follows  val c Ia   p c         p a   p c   p a    ll a        a         Then II a  f    If II  Then II a       II  a      If II a

THE THREE FORMALISMS  It is instructive to compare the qualitative behaviours of the simple link of Figure   when the conditional values that determine its behaviour are expressed us ing probability  possibility and evidence theories  This comparison exposes the differences in approach taken by the qualitative formalisms  providing some basis for choosing between them as methods of knowledge rep resentation  One way of representing the possible behaviours that a link may encode  is to specify the possible values of and for given values of Thus for probability theory we have   val val  a  a

Instead  it is intended as some indication of which formalism is best for a particular situation  If a permissive formal ism is required  then evidence theory may be the best choice  while probability might be better when a more restrictive formalism is needed     QUALITATIVE CHA NGES IN MORE COMPLEX NETWORKS  The analysis carried out in Section   allows us to pre dict how qualitative changes in certainty value will be propagated in a simple link between two nodes  Now  the change at C depends only on the change at A  and differential calculus tells us that so the behaviours of such links may be composed  Thus we can predict how qualitative changes are propagated in any network  quantified by   z  y oy ox   II a    IfIf II a  II a            val c   val    z  x     On reasoning in networks

independent of the effect of C  and vice versa   or we can use the proper joint probabilities of the three events B  C  and D  using values of the form p d I b c    In the first case we assume that the effects of B and C on D are completely independent of one another so that the variation of D with B  and D with C  is just as described by Theorem      the joint effect being established by using

we get an expression which has a similar be haviour to that given by Wellman for a synergetic re lation  In possibility theory we have a similar result to that for the simple link  Theorem      The

since it ensures the correctness of the integration introduced in Section    However  for reasoning using single formalisms  it may provde ad vantageous to extend the simpler apporach adopted by

and possibilities   QUALITATIVE CHANGE  The work described in this paper so far has extended qualitative reasoning about uncertainty handling for malisms to cover possibility and belief values as well as probability values  Not only is this useful in it self in providing a means of reasoning according to the  IT l II    i v Iv          II   I         v v  II             We can integrate this information allowing us to say how our belief in the patient in question being in pain    On reasoning in networks with qualitative uncertainty  and the possibility that the patient has vasculitic le sions  vary when we have new evidence that she is suffering from Sjorgen s syndrome  From the new ev           idence we have                          and        Since a change of     can never become a change of     or     we can ignore the latter changes  Now  from Theorem     and Theorem     we know that   p   t  p s  p d   p   p  s    d  p t     p v          p v         p   s   p s    p a            p a           p   s   p s  so that p a         and p v       from which we can deduce that p   a        and p   v               To continue our reasoning we need to establish the change in belief of and the change in possibility of To do this we make the monotonicity assumption  Parsons       that if the probability of a hypothesis increases then both the possibility of that hypothesis and the belief in it do not decrease  As well as being intuitively acceptable  this assumption is the weakest sensible relation between values expressed in different formalisms  and is compatible both with the principle of consistency between probability and possibility val ues laid down by Zadeh        and the natural exten sion of this principle to belief  necessity  Dubois and Prade     b   and plausibility values   l   a  The assumption also says that if the probability de creases then the possibility and belief do not increase  and so we can say that     OJ                    and           Now we apply Theorem     to find that   bel II   v  a   bel   a  II v     bel p            bel p       O   bel a   bel   a    bel   p           bel   p          bel a   be    a  Since we are initially ignorant about the possibility of vasculitis  we have II v    II   v       so that Theo rem     gives     p l            p l           p v   p   v    p   l     OJ   p   l     OJ  p   v   p v  Hence we can tell that bel p            bel   p       OJ and II v    II   v     OJ  The result of the  new evidence is that belief in the patient s pain may in crease  while the possibility of the patient having vas culitic lesions is unaffected  Thus we can use numeri cal values and qualitative relationships from different uncertainty handling formalisms to reason about the change in the belief of some event given information about the probability of a second event  and can in fer whether the possibility of a third event also varies  As a result reasoning about qualitative change allows some integration between formalisms           DISCUSSION  There is an important difference between the approach to qualitative reasoning under uncertainty described here  and that of Wellman      a  bJ  Despite their name  Wellman s Qualitative Probabilistic Networks do not describe the qualitative behaviour of probabilis tic networks exactly  In particular  some dependencies between variables are ignored in favour of simplicity  and synergy relations are sometimes introduced to rep resent them where it is considered to be important  In our approach  since it is based directly upon the various formalisms  the qualitative changes predicted are exactly those of the quantitative methods  This has been demonstrated in  Parsons and Saffiotti     J which analyses the representation of a real problem in a number of different qualitative and quantitative for malisms  In this analysis we make qualitative predic tions about the impact of evidence of faults in an elec tricity distribution network and compare these with the real quantitative changes  In every ca  e  for proba bility  possibility and belief values  the qualitative pre dictions were correct  This verification is a good in dication of the validity of the approach  and suggests that it will be useful in situations where incomplete information prevents the application of quantitative methods  Our qualitative method also provides a means of in tegrating uncertainty handling formalisms on a purely syntactic basis  For any hypothesis x about which we have uncertain information expressed  say in proba bility theory and possibility theory  we can make the intuitively reasonable assumption that if x   increases II  x   does not decrease  and thus translate from proba bility to possibility without worrying what probability or possibility actually mean   p   As a result any desired semantics may be attached to the values  a feature which finesses the problem of the acceptability of the semantics which must be faced by other  semantically based  schemes for integration  eg   Baldwin         The only problem with switch ing semantics would be that some combination rules might no longer apply  Dempster s rule in the case of Baldwin s voting model semantics  which would entail a re derivation of the appropriate propagation condi tions  Since the qualitative approach does not a priori  rule out any combination scheme  this is not a major difficulty  Finally  there is one important way that this method might be improved  The main disadvantage of any qualitative system is that there is no distinction be tween small values and large values  so       is qualita tively the same as           As a result we cannot dis tinguish between evidence that induces small changes in the certainty of a hypothesis and evidence that in duces large changes  This problem has been recognised for some time  and there is now a large body of work on order of magnitude reasoning  for example  Raiman        Parsons and Mamdani          Parsons and Dohnal        which attempts to automate reasoning of the form it  If A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C then A is bigger than C   The applications to our system are obvious  and we intend to do some work on this in the near future     SUMMARY  This paper has introduced a new method for qualita tive reasoning under uncertainty which is equally ap plicable to all uncertainty handling techniques  All that need be done to find the qualitative relation be tween two values is to write down the analytical ex pression relating them and take the derivative of this expression with respect to one of the values  This fact was illustrated by results from the qualitative analysis of the simplest possible reasoning networks in each of the three most widely used formalisms  Having established the qualitative behaviours of prob ability  possibility and evidence theories  the differ ences between these behaviours were discussed at some length  before knowledge of this behaviour was used to establish a form of qualitative integration between for malisms  In this integration numerical and qualitative data expressed in all three formalisms was used to help derive the change in belief of one node in a directed graph and the possibility of another from knowledge of a change in the probability of a third  related  node  Acknowledgements  The

Re entrant Structural Phase Transition in a Frustrated Kagome Magnet  Rb SnCu F   Lewis J  Downiea  Stephen P  Thompsonb  Chiu C  Tangb  Simon Parsonsc and Philip Lightfoot a Rb SnCu F   has been studied using synchrotron powder Xray diffraction  powder neutron diffraction and single crystal X ray diffraction at a range of temperatures           K   A broad but clear phase transition  possibly of re entrant character  is found to occur in the powder form  whereas the corresponding transition is not seen in the single crystal  Frustrated magnetism has been of great interest to both physicists and chemists for a long time due to the unusual effects and phenomena that it can encourage     These can include spin glasses  spin ices     and spin liquids   In the spin liquid  or resonating valence bond  state  there is such a high level of frustration that any tendency towards long range magnetic order is suppressed  even down to   K  This is of great fundamental interest as such a state may help the understanding of  for example  high temperature superconductivity  Magnetic frustration is often manifested in crystal structures containing triangular motifs of magnetic species  such as those based on the kagome lattice  In the specific case of kagome lattices based on S      ions  where the competition between long range ordering and quantum fluctuation effects is strongest  there have been several recently reported examples of spin liquidlike behaviour  Key examples are the Cu   based systems Herbertsmithite  and Kapellasite   and the V   system  NH    C H  N  V O F         Each of these examples has been shown to display persistent spin fluctuations down to below    mK  A related phenomenon  the so called valence bond solid or VBS state  in which localised  static spin pairing exists  but still without long range cooperative interactions  occurs in the compound Rb SnCu F    This is an attractive system for exploring crystal chemical influences on frustration due to the chemical flexibility inherent within the wider A MCu F   family    Some members of this family are reported to have a structural phase transition below room temperature which distorts their perfect kagome lattice      and therefore affects their preferred magnetic ground state  The crystal structure of Rb SnCu F   has only been examined in detail at room temperature    although some evidence for a phase transition near     K has been suggested    Even at room temperature  Rb SnCu F   does not possess a perfect Cu   kagome lattice  A structural frustration  perhaps caused by the incorporation of the smaller Rb  rather than Cs  cation  leads to a lowering of symmetry  specifically a doubling of the a and b parameters of the rhombohedral unit cell  and a disorder of the fluoride sublattice  when compared to the previously well characterised analogues Cs ZrCu F   and Cs SnCu F    These models are herein referred to as Rhomb   and Rhomb   as shown in Figure    The lowering of symmetry is suggested to be intrinsically related to the adoption of the unique VBS ground state  since it gives rise to four  rather than one  independent Cu  Cu superexchange pathways    This contrasts with the longrange antiferromagnetic order seen in the other family members   Fig     Unit cell of A MCu F   looking down the c axis  Red outline is the aristotype unit cell  Rhomb    common to Cs ZrCu F   and Cs SnCu F    yellow outline is the doubled cell  Rhomb    found for Rb SnCu F     Considering these differences it is of interest to probe the structural behaviour of Rb SnCu F   at low temperature  in order to compare and contrast to the structural and magnetic behaviour of Cs ZrCu F    The target compound was synthesised by an adaptation of the previously reported procedure    RbF  Sigma Aldrich         and SnF   Sigma Aldrich  were dried at     C under vacuum for approximately    hours  They were then mixed and ground with CuF   Sigma Aldrich      under argon in the molar stoichiometric ratio       before sealing in a gold tube  The tube was then heated under flowing argon at    C min   to     C for twelve hours before cooling at the same rate  In the case of single crystals the molar ratio was adjusted to        in order to provide a flux for crystal growth   the temperature to increased     C and the cooling rate slowed to     C hr    In all cases it was very difficult to synthesise the pure Rb SnCu F   phase  with significant impurities being Rb SnF  and CuO  In the powder diffraction experiments we were able to adequately account for these using multiphase Rietveld refinements       see ESI for further details   Fig     Portion of synchrotron powder diffraction pattern for Rb  SnCu F   at various temperatures    Synchrotron X ray powder diffraction experiments were performed at beamline I    Diamond Light Source    In this first experiment  Run     data were recorded at room temperature before quickly cooling to     K and allowing equilibration  before increasing the temperature  The room temperature data were well fitted by the proposed Rhomb   model  large cell  Figure    space group R    with a        A  c        A  previously derived from single crystal data    Specifically it was confirmed that the doubling of the aristotype unit cell was required  At around     K  on cooling  however  it was found that visible splittings occurred in some of the diffraction peaks  There are two possible causes of these splittings  a phase separation to two very similar phases  or a phase transition to a single  lower symmetry phase  A thermally induced phase separation has recently been reported in the multiferroic fluoride KxFeF     In the present case  the simplest model was tested  ie two Rhomb   like phases with differing lattice parameters and phase fractions  This model failed to account for the observed splittings  Initial modelling using a single lower symmetry phase was attempted using a monoclinic model which had previously been derived for the Cs ZrCu F   system    however  this was unable to explain some superstructure peaks necessitated by the doubled cell  By considering the possible distortions of the parent phase  using the ISODISTORT program    a triclinic model was found to account for all the observed peaks  see ESI for full details   This model  a maximal non isomorphic subgroup of Rhomb    provides the most plausible explanation of the observed data  However  due to its complexity  and the issues of sample purity  it was not possible to refine full details of this model  nevertheless  high quality fits were obtained by refining only the lattice and profile parameters  Further cooling  to approximately     K  leads to the disappearance of this splitting and a return to a pattern which is well fitted by the Rhomb   model  Fig    and     In order to probe this phenomenon further  and to confirm that this apparent re entrant phase transition is not an artefact due to sluggish kinetics  the experiment was repeated  this time using both heating and slow cooling cycles  Run     The sample was cooled slowly from     K to     K  below the suggested transition  and heated to     K again  with several data collections carried out during each ramp  In this case it was found that  visually at least  there was a clear transition from the Rhomb   to the triclinic phase  and back to the Rhomb   phase on both heating and cooling  Rietveld refinement showed a hysteresis in the phase transition temperature and a mixed phase zone in both directions  both suggestive that the phase transition is  st order in nature  To obtain a definitive structure for the intermediate triclinic phase and to investigate the relationship between the low temperature and room temperature rhombohedral phases  single crystal X ray diffraction was performed  Data were collected on two separate crystals  In the first experiment a crystal was mounted at     K  After data collection  the crystal was warmed to     K  cooled to     K and then warmed to     K  To our surprise  all three datasets  collected at          and     K were indexable and refined well in the Rhomb   model  with R factors of around    in each case  see ESI for details   It was also found that the previously reported structural disorder was present  Fig     Percentage of Rhomb   phase present in two samples   at all three temperatures  In a second single crystal experiment data were collected at          and     K on cooling  in this case the quality of the refinement using the same Rhomb   model was inferior at     K to that at     K  R  values of       and        respectively   Significantly  there was no evidence for loss of three fold symmetry  however  re integrating the     K data in a much larger and lower symmetry unit cell  model Trig    space group P    a        A  c        A    as tentatively suggested by Matan et al     did reveal some evidence for additional very weak scattering in the enlarged cell  The weakness of these possible superlattice reflections precluded any reasonable refinement  We re iterate that this enlarged  but high symmetry  unit cell does not account for the peak splittings seen in the intermediate  triclinic  phase in our powder experiments  In order to further explore the reproducibility of the powder experiments an analogous experiment was carried out using powder neutron diffraction  see ESI for details   It was found that further refinement for full structural details was prohibited  Fig     Rietveld fits to the synchrotron powder data at different temperatures  In this case only single Rb SnCu F   phases were used  Rhomb   model at     and     K  triclinic model  P    at     K  Red tick marks correspond to Rb SnCu F    orange to Rb SnF   and blue to RbCuF     due to impurity levels but at room temperature and     K the pattern was successfully fitted in the Rhomb   model and at     K in the triclinic cell  This confirmed the essential behaviour proposed in the synchrotron powder experiments  From the present study it is clear that powder samples of Rb SnCu F   show curious and hitherto unreported phase transition behaviour  The reproducible transition from rhombohedral to triclinic to rhombohedral phases on cooling and re heating strongly suggests a re entrant structural phase transition  Unfortunately  the exact details of each crystal structure cannot be ascertained from the powder diffraction data alone  and both the present and previous single crystal studies clearly show behaviour different to all the present powder based studies  In particular it is not clear whether the two Rhomb   phases surrounding the triclinic phase are truly identical or whether they differ  for example  in the degree or nature of the fluoride disordering  Purely structural re entrant phase transitions in crystalline materials are very rare  A recent study suggests only three known examples    this has now been supplemented by one further possible case    Interestingly  in the latter case  the transformation has the same group subgroup relationship  R   to P    as presented here  though it is suggested that the transition is due to competition between a weak Jahn Teller effect and magnetic ordering  in our case the cause is more likely to be purely structural and related to the fluorine disorder   Notes and 
  Qualitative probabilistic networks have been de signed for probabilistic reasoning in a qualita tive way  Due to their coarse level of represen tation detail  qualitative probabilistic networks do not provide for resolving trade offs and typ ically yield ambiguous results upon inference  We present an algorithm for computing more in sightful results for unresolved trade offs  The al gorithm builds upon the idea of using pivots to zoom in on the trade offs and identifying the in formation that would serve to resolve them     INTRODUCTION  Qualitative probabilistic networks were introduced in the early     s for probabilistic reasoning with uncertainty in a qualitative way  Wellman         A qualitative prob abilistic network encodes variables and the probabilistic relationships between them in a directed acyclic graph  The encoded relationships basically represent influences on probability distributions  Each of these influences is sum marised by a qualitative sign indicating the direction of shift in one variable s distribution occasioned by a shift in another variable s distribution  For probabilistic inference with qualitative networks  an elegant algorithm based upon the idea of propagating and combining signs is available  Druzdzel   Henrion      a    Qualitative probabilistic networks capture the relationships between their variables at a coarse level of representation detail  As a consequence  these networks do not provide for resolving trade offs  that is  for establishing the net re sult of two or more conflicting influences on a variable s probability distribution  If trade offs are represented in a qualitative network  then probabilistic inference will typi cally yield ambiguous results  Once an ambiguity arises  it will spread throughout most of the network upon infer ence  even if only a very small part of the network is truly ambiguous   The issue of dealing with trade offs in qualitative prob abilistic networks has been addressed before by several researchers  S  Parsons has introduced  for example  the concept of categorical influences  A categorical influence is either an influence that serves to increase a probability to   or an influence that decreases a probability to    re gardless of any other influences  and thereby resolves any trade off in which it is involved  Parsons          C  L  Liu and M  P  Wellman have designed a method for resolving trade offs based upon the idea of reverting to numerical probabilities whenever necessary  Liu   Wellman         S  Renooij and L C  van der Gaag have enhanced the ba sic formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks by dis tinguishing between strong and weak influences  Trade off resolution during inference is then based on the idea that strong influences dominate over conflicting weak ones  Renooij   Van der Gaag          These approaches to trade off resolution are all based on a refinement of the rep resentation used in the basic formalism  In this paper  we present a new algorithm for dealing with trade offs in qualitative probabilistic networks  Rather than resolving trade offs by providing for a finer level of rep resentation detail  our algorithm identifies the information that would serve to resolve the trade offs present in a quali tative probabilistic network  From this information  a more insightful result than ambiguity is constructed  Our algorithm for dealing with trade offs builds upon the idea of zooming in on the part of a qualitative probabilis tic network where the actual trade offs reside  After a new observation has been entered into the network  probabilis tic inference will provide the sign of the influence of this observation on the variable of interest  given previously en tered observations  If this sign is ambiguous  then there are trade offs present in the network  In fact  a trade off must reside along the reasoning chains between the observation and the variable of interest  Our algorithm isolates these reasoning chains to constitute the part of the network that is relevant for addressing the trade offs present  From this relevant part  an informative result is constructed for the variable of interest in terms of values for the variables in         UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS       volved and the relative strengths of the influences between them  We believe that qualitative probabilistic networks can play an important role in the construction of quantitative proba bilistic networks for real life application domains  as well as for explanation of their reasoning processes  The con struction of a probabilistic network typically sets out with the construction of the network s digraph  As the assess ment of the various probabilities required is a far harder task  it is performed only when the network s digraph is considered robust  Now  by assessing signs for the influ ences modelled in the digraph  a qualitative network is ob tained that can be exploited for studying the projected prob abilistic network s reasoning behaviour prior to the assess ment of its probabilities  For this purpose  algorithms are required that serve to derive as much information as possi ble from a qualitative probabilistic network  We look upon our algorithm as a first step to this end  The paper is organised as follows  In Section    we pro vide some preliminaries concerning qualitative probabilis tic networks  In Section    we introduce our algorithm for zooming in on trade offs informally  by means of an ex ample  The algorithm is discussed in further detail in Sec tion    The paper ends with some concluding observations in Section       PRELIMINARIES  A qualitative probabilistic network encodes the statistical variables from a domain of application and the probabilis tic relationships between them in a directed acyclic graph G  V G    A G      Each node in the set V G  repre sents a statistical variable  Each arc in the set A G  can be looked upon as expressing a causal influence from the node at the tail of the arc on the node at the arc s head  More for mally  the set of arcs captures probabilistic independence among the represented variables  We say that a chain be tween two nodes is blocked if it includes either an observed node with at least one outgoing arc or an unobserved node with two incoming arcs and no observed descendants  If all chains between two nodes are blocked  then these nodes are said to be d separated and the corresponding variables are considered conditionally independent given the entered observations  Pearl             A qualitative probabilistic network associates with its di graph G a set  of qualitative influences and synergies  Wellman          A qualitative influence between two nodes expresses how the values of one node influence the probabilities of the values of the other node  A positive qualitative influence of node A on its successor B expresses that observing higher values for A makes higher values for B more likely  regardless of any other direct influences on B  the influence is denoted S  A  B    where    is the in fluence s sign  A negative qualitative influence  denoted  S j  and a zero qualitative influence  denoted S    are de fined analogously  If the influence of node A on node B is not monotonic or unknown  we say that it is ambiguous  denoted Sb A  B    The set of influences of a qualitative probabilistic net work exhibits various properties  Wellman          The property of symmetry states that  if the network includes the influence Sb A  B    then it also includes Sb B  A    J E                The property of transitivity asserts that qualitative influences along a simple chain that specifies at most one incoming arc for each node  combine into a single influence with the  operator from Table    The property of composition asserts that multiple influences between two nodes along parallel chains combine into a single influence with the EB operator  Table    The   and EB operators                                                 EB                                          In addition to influences  a qualitative probabilistic net work includes synergies that express how the value of one node influences the probabilities of the values of another node in view of a value for a third node  Druzdzel   Henrion      b    A negative product synergy of node A on node B  and vice versa  given the value c for their common successor C  denoted X    A  B   c    ex presses that  given c  higher values for A render higher val ues for B less likely  Positive  zero  and ambiguous prod uct synergies are defined analogously  A product synergy induces a qualitative influence between the predecessors of a node upon observation of that node  the induced influence is coined an intercausal influence  In this paper  we assume that induced intercausal influences are added to a qualita tive probabilistic network s graph as undirected edges  procedure PropagateSign from to message    sign to   sign to  EB message  for each  induced  neighbour Vi of to do linksign  sign of  induced

Algorithm  For probabilistic inference with a qualitative probabilis tic network  an elegant algorithm is available from M J  Druzdzel and M  Henrion      a   this algorithm is summarised in pseudocode in Figure    The basic idea of the algorithm is to trace the effect of observing a node s value on the other nodes in a network by message passing   UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS  between neighbouring nodes  For each node  a node sign is determined  indicating the direction of change in the node s probability distribution occasioned by the new ob servation given all previously observed node values  Ini tially  all node signs equal       For the newly observed node  an appropriate sign is entered  that is  either a     for the observed value true or a     for the value false  by calling PropagateSign observed node  observed node  sign   Each node receiving a message updates its sign and sub sequently sends a message to each neighbour that is not d separated from the observed node and to every node on which it exerts an induced intercausal influence  The sign of this message is the   product of the node s  new  sign and the sign of the influence it traverses  This process is re peated throughout the network  building on the properties of symmetry  transitivity  and composition of influences  The process repeatedly visits each node that needs a change of sign  Since a node can change sign at most twice  once from   to  or   and then only to    each node is visited at most twice  The process is therefore guaranteed to halt     OUTLINE OF THE ALGORITHM  If a qualitative probabilistic network models trade offs  it will typically yield ambiguous results upon inference with the sign propagation algorithm  From Table    we have that whenever two conflicting influences on a node are combined with the EEl operator  an ambiguous sign will re sult  Once an ambiguous sign is introduced  it wil l spread throughout most of the network and an ambiguous sign is likely to result for the node of interest  By zooming in on the part of the network where the actual trade offs reside and identifying the information that would serve to resolve these trade offs  a more insightful result can be constructed  We illustrate the basic idea of our algorithm to this end              Figure    The Result of Propagating     for NodeH  has

on every node s distribution by means of the sign propagation algorithm  results in the node signs shown in Figure    These signs reveal that at least one trade off must reside along the reasoning chains between the observed node H and the node of interest A  These chains together constitute the part of the network that is relevant for addressing the trade offs that have given rise   to the ambiguous result for node A  we term this part the relevant network  For the example  the relevant network is shown in Figure   below the dashed line  Our algorithm now isolates this relevant network for further investigation  To this end  it deletes from the network all nodes and arcs that are connected to  but no part of the reasoning chains fromH to A  A relevant network for addressing trade offs typically in cludes many nodes with ambiguous node signs  Often  however  only a small number of these nodes are actually involved in the trade offs that have given rise to the am biguous result for the node of interest  Figures   and    for example  reveal that  while the nodes A  B  and C have ambiguous node signs  the influences between them are not conflicting  In fact  every possible unambiguous node sign sign C  for node C would result in the unambiguous sign sign C            EB   sign C    for node A  For addressing the trade offs involved  therefore  the part of the relevant network between node C and node A can be dis regarded  Node C in fact separates the part of the relevant network that contains trade offs from the part that does not  We call node C the pivot node for the node of interest     Figure    The Example Qualitative Probabilistic Network  As our running example  we consider the qualitative proba bilistic network from Figure    Suppose that the value true  In general  the pivot node in a relevant network is a node with an ambiguous sign for which every possible unam biguous sign would uniquely determine an unambiguous sign for the node of interest  in

network  the nodes from the resolution frontier exert two separate influences on the pivot node C  the influence from node I via node Don C and the influence from G on C  For the sign   of the influence of node I via node Don C and for the sign o  of the influence of G on C  we find that    Figure    The Relevant Network  below the Dashed Line  observed node to the pivot node  that is  the pivot node is the node with this property  closest  to the observed node  Note that every network includes such a node  Our algo rithm now selects from the relevant network the pivot node for the node of interest  From the definition of pivot node  it can be shown that there must be two or more different reasoning chains in the rel evant network from the observed node to the pivot node  the net influences along these reasoning chains  moreover  must be conflicting or ambiguous  To resolve the ambiguity at the pivot node  the relative strengths of the various influ ences as well as the signs of some of the nodes involved need be known  From Figures   and    for example  we have that node I lies at the basis of the ambiguous sign for the pivot node C  Note that it receives an ambiguous node sign itself as a result of two conflicting  non ambiguous  influences  An unambiguous node sign for node I would not suffice to fix an unambiguous sign for node C  Even knowledge of the relative strengths of the two conflicting influences from node I on the pivot node would not suf fice for this purpose  however  a positive node sign for node I  for example  would still cause node G  residing on one of the reasoning chains from I to C  to receive an ambiguous node sign  which in tum gives rise to an am biguous influence on C  Node G therefore also lies at the basis of the ambiguity at the pivot node  Now  every com bination of unambiguous node signs for the nodes G and I would render the separate influences on the pivot node unambiguous  Knowledge of the relative strengths of these influences would suffice to determine an unambiguous sign for the pivot node  We call a minimal set of nodes having this property the resolutionfrontier for the pivot node  In terms of signs for the nodes from the resolution frontier  our algorithm now constructs a  conditional  sign for the pivot node by comparing the relative strengths of the vari ous influences exerted on it upon inference  In the example        sign I            sign I                sign G       sign G     where Di  i          are as in Figure    For the node sign sign C  of the pivot node  the algorithm now constructs the    following result  if              then sign C         else sign C           where     denotes the strength of the sign    So  if the two influences on node C have opposite signs  then their rela tive strengths will determine the sign for node C  The sign of the node of interest A then follows directly from the node sign of C     SPLITTING UP AND CONSTRUCTING SIGNS  In this section we detail some of the issues involved in our algorithm for pivotal pruning of trade offs  In doing so  we assume that a qualitative probabilistic network does not in clude any ambiguous influences  that

  IDENTIFYING THE RELEVANT NETWORK  Our algorithm identifies from a qualitative probabilistic network the relevant part for addressing the trade offs that have resulted in an ambiguous sign for the node of inter est  We begin by formally defining the concept of relevant network  Definition   Let Q  G    be a qualitative probabilistic network as defined in Section    Let   be the set of previ ously observed nodes in Q  let E be the node for which new evidence has become available  and let I be the network s node of interest  The relevant network for E and I given   is the qualitative probabilistic network Qrel  G      such that            V G   consists of all nodes that occur on a chain from  E to I that is not blocked by     A G        V G    x  V G     n A G    and    consists of all qualitative influences and synergies from  that involve nodes from G  only   The concept of relevance has been introduced before  most notably for quantitative probabilistic networks  see for ex ample  Druzdzel   Suermondt        Shachter          In fact  for quantitative and qualitative probabilistic networks various different concepts of relevance have been distin guished  For a node of interest I  previously observed nodes    and a newly observed nodeE  we say that a node N is   structurally relevant to I  if N is not d separated from I given   U  E             computationally nor dynamically relevant to the node of interest A  The concept of dynamic relevance was introduced to de note the nodes constituting the reasoning chains between a newly observed node and a node of interest in a probabilis tic network  Druzdzel   Suermondt         The set of all nodes that are dynamically relevant to the node of interest I and the newly observed nodeE  given the previously ob served nodes    can in fact be shown to induce the relevant network forE and I given    as defined in Definition    From a qualitative probabilistic network  the set of dy namically relevant nodes can be established by first deter mining all nodes that are computationally relevant to the node of interest I and then removing the nodes that are not on any reasoning chain from the newly observed node E to I  For computing the set of all computationally rele vant nodes  the efficient Bayes Ball algorithm is available from R D  Shachter         The algorithm takes for its in put a probabilistic network  the set of all observed nodes   U  E   and the node of interest I  it returns the sets of nodes that are computationally relevant  or requisite  to I  From the set of computationally relevant nodes  all nodes that are not on any reasoning chain from the newly observed node E to the node of interest I need be iden tified  these nodes are termed nuisance nodes for E and I  An efficient algorithm is available for identifying these nodes  Lin   Druzdzel         The algorithm takes for its input a computationally relevant network  the set of previ ously observed nodes    the newly observed node E  and the node of interest I  it returns the set of nuisance nodes for E and I  The algorithm for computing the relevant part of a qualitative probabilistic network is summarised in

is structurally rele vant to node A yet neither computationally nor dynamically relevant  Node J is structurally irrelevant to the observed nodeH  as is also evidenced by its node sign     upon in ference  it is both structurally and computationally relevant to the node of interest A  yet dynamically irrelevant  The newly observed node H is d separated from A by its be ing observed  It therefore is not structurally relevant to A  it is computationally as well as dynamically relevant to A  however  Node M  to conclude  is neither structurally nor           Figure    The Algorithm for Computing the Relevant Net work       IDENTIFYING THE PIVOT NODE  After establishing the relevant part of a qualitative proba bilistic network for addressing the trade offs present  our algorithm identifies the pivot node  The pivot node serves to separate the part of the relevant network that contains the trade offs that have given rise to the ambiguous sign for the node of interest  from the part that does not con    UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS            tain these trade offs  The pivot node will allow for further focusing  We recall that the pivot node is a node with an ambiguous node sign  for which every possible unambigu ous sign would uniquely determine an unambiguous sign for the node of interest  We define the concept of pivot node more formally   Let Q  G     be a relevant qualitative probabilistic network  let   be the set of previously ob served nodes  let E be the newly observed node  and let I be the network s node of interest  as before  The pivot node for I and E is a node P E V  G  such that  Definition      Sb E  P     Sb  P  I        E E   with o            with              and  there does not exist a node P  with the above prop erties that resides on a chain from E to P that is not blocked by     The pivot node in a relevant qualitative probabilistic net work has various convenient properties  Before discussing these properties  we briefly review the concept of an ar ticulation node from graph theory  In a digraph  an ar ticulation node is a node that upon removal along with its incident arcs  makes the digraph fall apart into vari ous separate components  In the digraph of our example network  as shown in Figure    the articulation nodes are the nodes C  D  H  I  and L  for the relevant network  de picted in Figure    node C is the only articulation node  however  Articulation nodes are identified using a depth first search algorithm  for details  we refer the reader to  Cormen et al          Theorems   and   now state impor tant properties of a pivot node that allow for its identifica tion  Theorem    Theorem   Let Q  G     be a relevant qualitative probabilistic network  let E and I be as before  The pivot node for I and E is unique     Proof   sketch   From Definition   we have that the rele vant network consists of only nodes that reside on an un blocked chain from the newly observed node E to the node of interest I  From the definition of articulation node  we further have that every such chain must include all articula tion nodes in the relevant network  In fact  every reasoning chain from E to I visits the articulation nodes in the same order  From Definition   we have that no two pivot nodes can reside on the same unblocked chain to the node of in terest  We conclude that the pivot node is unique     From the proof of Theorem   we have that the articula tion nodes in a relevant network allow a total ordering  We number the articulation nodes  together with the node of in terest I  from I  for the node closest to the newly observed node  to m  for the node of interest  The pivot node now is the node with the lowest ordering number for which an unambiguous sign would uniquely determine an unambigu ous sign for the node of interest  To identify the pivot node  our algorithm starts with investigating the articulation node closest to the node of interest  this node is numbered m      The algorithm investigates whether an unambiguous sign for this candidate pivot node would result in an unambigu ous sign for the node of interest upon sign propagation  By propagating a     from the candidate pivot node to the node of interest I  the node sign resulting for I is the sign of the net influence of the candidate pivot node on I  If this sign is ambiguous  then the node of interest itself is the pivot node  Otherwise  the algorithm proceeds by investigating the ar ticulation node numbered m    and so on  The algorithm is summarised in pseudocode in Figure       function ComputePivot Q    candidates    I  U FindArticulationNodes G   order the nodes from candidates from   to m  return FindPivot m       Let Q  G     be a relevant qualitative probabilistic network  let E be the newly observed node and let I be the node of interest  The pivot node for I and E is either the node of interest I or an articulation node in    function FindPivot i   pivot  G   PropagateSign node i node i      if sign node i          then return node i      else FindPivot i     Proof  sketch    By definition we have that every possible unambiguous node sign for the pivot node determines an unambiguous sign for the node of interest I  It will be ev ident that node I itself satisfies this property  Either the node of interest I or another node on an unblocked chain from E to I  therefore  is the pivot node  Now  suppose that node I is not the pivot node  As a sign for the pivot node uniquely determines the sign for I  we conclude that all influences exerted upon I must traverse the pivot node  Every unblocked chain from E to I  therefore  must include the pivot node  As a consequence  removing the pivot node along with its incident arcs from the relevant network will cause the network to fall apart into separate components  We conclude that the pivot node is an articulation node     pivot        Figure    The Algorithm for Computing the Pivot Node       CONSTRUCTING RESULTS  From its definition  we have that there must be two or more different reasoning chains in the relevant network from the newly observed node to the pivot node  the net influences along these reasoning chains are conflicting or ambiguous  Our algorithm focuses on the ambiguity at the pivot node and identifies the information that would serve to resolve it  For this purpose  the algorithm zooms in on the part   UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS       of the relevant network between the newly observed node and the pivot node  we call this part the pruned relevant network  Note that the pruned relevant network is readily computed by exploiting the property that the pivot node is an articulation node  From the pruned relevant network  the algorithm first selects the so called candidate resolvers  Definition   Let Q  G    be a relevant qualitative probabilistic network  let E be the newly observed node and let I be the network s node of interest  Let P be the pivot node for I and E  Now  let Qpru  G      be the pruned relevant network for P  A candidate resolver for P is a node Ri E V G     Ri  f  P  such that    where j j once again is used to denote the strength of the sign    We would like to note that as  in general  the resolu tion frontier includes a small number of nodes  the number of signs to be computed for the pivot node is limited  In ad dition  we note that the process of constructing informative results can be repeated recursively for the nodes in the pivot node s resolution frontier  until the newly observed node is reached  The basic algorithm is summarised in pseudocode in Figure    procedure ConstructResults Q pivot       Ri    sign Ri      and in degree Ri J           Qpru

candidate resolvers for P  as defined in Definition    The resolution frontier F for P is the maximal subset of R such that for each candidate resolver Ri E F there exists at least one unblocked chain from E via Ri to P such that no node Rj E R resides on the subchain from Ri to P        Figure    The Algorithm for Constructing Results  To conclude  we would like to note that for computing in formative results for a relevant network s pivot node  the pruned network can be even further restricted  To this end  a so called boundary node can be identified for the newly observed node  The boundary node is the articulation node closest to the node of interest that has an unambiguous node sign after propagation of the observation entered  Con structing results can then focus on the part of the relevant network between the pivot node and the boundary node  Moreover  if the thus pruned network includes many artic ulation nodes  it may very well be that trade offs exist be tween the articulation nodes numbered k   and k  but not between k and k      Distinguishing between these com ponents is straightforward and allows for further focusing on the actual trade offs involved in inference        CONCLUSIONS  We have presented a new algorithm for dealing with trade offs in qualitative probabilistic networks  Rather than re solve trade offs by providing for a finer level of representa tion detail  our algorithm identifies from a qualitative prob abilistic network the information that would serve to re solve the trade offs present  For this purpose  the algorithm zooms in on the part of the network where the actual trade offs reside and identifies the pivot node for the node of in    UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS            terest  The sign of the pivot node uniquely determines the sign of the node of interest  For the pivot node  a more informative result than ambiguity is constructed in terms of values for the node s resolvers and the relative strengths of the influences upon it  This process of constructing in formative results can be repeated recursively for the pivot node s resolvers  As we have already mentioned in our introduction  we be lieve that qualitative probabilistic networks can play an im portant role in the construction of quantitative networks for real life application domains  as well as for explanation of their reasoning processes  For the purpose of explanation  qualitative probabilistic networks have been proposed be fore  The concept of pivot node for zooming in on trade offs and constructing insightful results for a network s node of interest is a very powerful concept to enable explanation of complex reasoning processes in quantitative probabilis tic networks  Acknowledgments  This work

  We propose a formal framework for intelligent systems which can reason about scientific do mains  in particular about the carcinogenicity of chemicals  and we study its properties  Our framework is grounded in a philosophy of sci entific enquiry and discourse  and uses a model of dialectical argumentation  The formalism en ables representation of scientific uncertainty and conflict in a manner suitable for qualitative rea soning about the domain      INTRODUCTION  We seek to build intelligent systems which can reason au tonomously about the risk of carcinogenicity of chemicals  drawing on whatever theoretical or experimental evidence is available  In earlier work  McBurney   Parsons        reviewing the literature on methods of carcinogen risk as sessment  we listed the different types of evidence adduced to support these claims  which may be in the form of  ex perimental results on tissue cultures  animals or human epi demiological studies  analytical comparisons with known carcinogens  or explication of biomedical causal pathways  Evidence from these different sources may conflict  and carcinogen risk assessment usually involves the compar ison and resolution of multiple evidence  E P A  U S  A       Graham  Green    Roberts        In representing this domain  it therefore seems appropriate to use some form of argumentation  so that the reasons for claims can be represented in association with the claims themselves   and within a dialectical framework  so that cases for and against a particular claim can be compared   In particular  dialectical argumentation enables the representation of un certainty in the underlying scientific knowledge base  This paper presents such a dialectical formalism for an intelli gent system  which we termed a Risk Agora in our earlier work  We begin by examining the nature of scientific dis course           SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE  A MODEL OF SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRY  Our chosen application domain is a scientific one  To repre sent this domain  therefore  we seek to ground our formal ism in a philosophical model of scientific enquiry  Firstly  we require a theory of the nature of modem science  Fol lowing Pera         we view the enterprise of science as a three person dialogue  involving a scientific investiga tor  Nature and a skeptical scientific community  In Pera s model  the investigator proposes theoretical explanations of scientific phenomena and undertakes scientific experiments to test these  The experiments lead to  replies  from Na ture in the form of experimental evidence  However  Na ture s responses are not given directly or in a pure form  but are mediated through the third participant  the scien tific community  which interprets the evidence  undertakes a debate as to its meaning and implications  and eventually decides in favor or against proposed theoretical explana tions  The consequence of this model for our formalism is that we provide Nature with a formal role  but manifest it through those of the other participants  But Pera s model of modem science as a dialogue game could apply to many other human dialogues  most of which do not share science s success in explaining and predict ing natural phenomena  Our model of science therefore requires an explanation of its success  Some philosophers of science believe this is due to the application of univer sal principles of assessment of proposed scientific theo ries  such as the falsificationism of Popper or the confir mationism of Camap  However  we do not share these views  instead believing  with Feyerabend         that the standards of assessment used by any scientific community are domain   context  and time dependent  This view  that there are neither universal nor objective standards by which scientific theories can be judged  was called  epistemolog ical anarchism  by Lakatos  Lakatos   Feyerabend        Instead of universal principles of assessment of theories  we believe science s success arises in part from applying two normative principles of conduct  firstly  that every the    UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS            oretical explanation proposed by a scientific investigator is contestable by anyone  and secondly  that every theoretical explanation adopted by a scientific community is defeasi ble  In other words  all scientific theories  no matter how compelling  are always tentative  being held only until bet ter explanations are found  and anyone may propose these   To build an intelligent system based on these principles  we therefore require a  normative  model of scientific discourse which enables contestation and defeasibility of claims  Our model has several components  At the high est level  we are attempting to model a discourse between reasonable  consenting scientists  who accept or reject ar guments only on the basis of their relative force  An in fluential model for debates of this type is the philosophy of Discourse Ethics developed by Habermas         for de bates in ethical and moral domains  Our formalism there fore draws on Habermas  in particular his rules of discourse first fully articulated by Alexy         and these form the basis of the desired properties of the Agora formalism pre sented later in this section   Next  within this structure  we wish to be able to model dialogues in which different participants variously posit  assert  contest  justify  qualify and retract claims  To rep resent such activity requires a model of an argument  and we use Toulmin s        model  within a dialectical frame work  To embody our belief in epistemological anarchism  we permit participants to contest any component of a sci entific argument  its premises  its rules of inference  Toul min  s  warrants    its degrees of support  his  modalities    and its consequences  We believe this is exactly what real scientists do when confronted with new theoretical expla nations of natural phenomena  Feyerabend        When a scientific claim is thus contested  its proponent may re spond  not only by retracting it  but by qualifying it in some way  perhaps reducing its scope of applicability  Naess         called this process  precizating   and we seek to enable such responses in the system  We thus ground our formalism for the Agora in a model of scientific discourse as dialectical argumentation       DESIRED AGORA PROPERTIES  As mentioned  we desire our Agora formalism to satisfy the rules for a reasoned discourse proposed by Alexy         which are listed here  In restating these  we have modi fied and re ordered them slightly  and have ignored rules which deal specifically with discussion of ethical matters  Also  because our formalism is intended for debate regard ing only one chemical at a time  we have ignored Alexy s    These two principles are each necessary to explain science s  success  but not sufficient    Alexy s  rules have some similarity with Grice s        Max  ims for Conversation    Further details of our philosophy of science are contained in   McBurney   Parsons     b    rules regarding the relevance of utterances  We have also added a property concerning precization  Pl Anyone may participate in the Agora  and they may execute dialogue moves at any time  subject only to move specific conditions  defined below   P  Participation entails acceptance of the semantics for the logical language used  and of the associated modality  degrees of support  dictionaries  P  Any participant may assert any claim or consequence of a claim  but may do so only when they have a grounded argument for the claim  respectively  a con sequential argument from the claim   P  Any participant may question or challenge any claim or any consequence of a claim  PS Any participant who asserts a claim  respectively  a consequence of a claim  must provide a valued grounded argument for that claim  respectively  a val ued consequential argument from the claim  if queried or challenged by another participant  P  Any participant may question or challenge the grounds  the rules of inference or the modalities for any claim  P  Whenever a participant asserts a valued grounded argu ment for a claim  or a valued consequential argument from a claim   any other participant may assert a val ued grounded argument  respectively  a valued conse quential argument  for the same claim with different dictionary values  PS A participant who has provided a grounded argument for a claim which has been challenged should be able to respond by qualifying  precizating  the original claim or argument  P  Any participant who provides a grounded argument for  or a consequential argument from  a claim is not required to provide further defence if no counter arguments are provided by other participants  PlO No participant may contradict him or herself          THE RISK AGORA FORMALISM  PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS  We begin by assuming the system is intended to represent debate regarding the carcinogenicity of a specific chemi cal  and that statements concerning this can be expressed in a propositional language   whose well formed formu lae  wffs  we denote by lower case Greek letters  Subsets of   i e  sets of wffs  are denoted by upper case Greek letters  and  is assumed closed under the usual connec tives  We assume multiple modes of inference

regarding their validity in any truth model  We assume a finite set of debate participants  denoted by Pi  who are permitted to introduce new wffs and new modes of inference at any time  We denote Nature  in its role in the debate  by PN  Definition    A grounded argument for a claim    de noted A        is a   tuple  G R O   where G     o                  n   On    n    is an ordered se quence of wffs  i and possibly  empty sets of wffs  i  with n    and withR    h  h           n  an ordered sequence ofinference rules such that   In other words  each   k  k            n    is derived from

  the grounds or premises  for Ok     Definition    A consequential argument from a claim     denoted A O        is a   tuple    R C   where C     o                  n   On    n   On  is an ordered

in C are derivations from    arising from the successive application of the rules of in ference in R  and we call each   k in C a consequence of    In order that participants may effectively state and con test degrees of commitment to claims  we require a com mon dictionary of degrees of commitment or support  what Toulrnin called  modalities    Our formalism will support any agreed dictionary  whether quantitative  such as a set of probability values or belief measures  or qualitative  such as non numeric symbols or linguistic qualifiers   provided there is a partial order on its elements  We define dictionar ies for modalities for claims  grounds  consequences and rules of inference   Definition    Four modality dictionaries are defined as fol lows  each being a  possibly infinite  set of elements having a partial order  Theclaims dictionary is denoted by Vc  the grounds dictionary by Va  the consequences dictionary by VQ  and the inference dictionary by VI  Because claims  grounds and consequences are all elements of the same language  C  two or more of the dictionaries Vc  Va and VQ may be the same  However  a distinct dictionary will generally be required for VI    Because of our belief in epistemological anarchism  we do not specify rules of assignment of dictionary labels by participants in the Agora  In particular  the labels assigned to the conclu sions and consequences of arguments are not constrained by those assigned to premises or rules of inference  Example I  The generic argumentation dictionary defined for assessment of risk by  Krause et al        is an exam ple of a linguistic dictionary for statements about claims  grounds or consequences  comprising the set   Certain  Confirmed  Probable  Plausible  Supported  Open   The elements of this dictionary are listed in descending order  with each successive labelindicating a weaker beliefin the claim  Example    Two examples of Inference Dictionaries are VI   Valid  Invalid  andVI    Acceptable  Sometimes Acceptable  Open  Not Acceptable   Definition    A valued grounded argument for a claim     denoted A    O D   is a   tuple  G R O D   where  G R    is a grounded argument for    and D  do d         dn   do r  r       rn  is an ordered se quence of labels and vectors of labels  with eachdi a vector of dictionary labelsfrom Vc  fori            n     with do E Vc and with ri E VI  fori              n   Each vector di comprises those values of theClaimsDictionary assigned to grounds   i  u  i  the elementdo is that value of the Claims Dictionary assigned to   and each element ri is that value of the InferenceDictionary assigned to    i  A valued consequential argument from a claim    denoted A        D   is defined similarly              DISCOURSE RULES  We next define the rules for discourse participants  building on the definitions above  Moves are denoted by   ary or   ary functions of the form name Pi       where the first argument denotes the participant executing the move  If the move responds to an earlier move by another participant  that earlier move is the second argument  Arguments are separated by colons  In Section    we will show that these rules give operational effect to the Desired Properties      In  McBurney   Parsons     c   we model degrees of ac  ceptability of inference rules    UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS

Pi at any time may move   where I t is a mode of inference and rt E V   This move informs the community that participant Pi be lieves that I t is a mode of inference of strength at least Tt  Note that the query and assertions rules are not symmet ric between grounded and consequential arguments  partic ipants may only propose or assert claims for which they have grounded arguments  but they need not necessarily have considered the consequences of these claims  Next  we explicitly define the ContestClaimrule  with other con testation rules being defined similarly  For brevity in the following  we sometimes write A for A         D   Rule    Contestation Moves     Contest Claim  W henever proposeor assert relating to    de  has been moved by participant Pi  any other participant Pi may

Hamblin       Walton   Krabbe       Amgoud  Maudet    Parsons        we define sets called Commit ment Stores which contain the proposals and assertions made by participants  both individually and for the Agora as a community  and track these as they change  Definition    The commitment store of player Pi  i             denoted CS Pi   is a possibly empty set   B do  I    E   do E Vc   Each do is the claim dic tionary value assigned by Pi toB     The values in participants  stores are updated by the fol lowing rule    UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS            Rule    Participant Commitment Store Update  When ever participantPi executes the moves  Rule    Nature s Modalities  The modality do N of Na ture for the claim    is assigned as follows   propose Pi     do       If    is a wff for which no grounded argument has yet been provided by a participant  then do N is assigned the value Open     If   is a wff for which at least one grounded argument has been provided by a participant  then do N is as signed the value Supported     If   is a wff for which a grounded and consistent argu ment has been provided by a participant  then do Nis assigned the value Plausible     If    is a wff for which a grounded and consistent ar gument has been provided by a participant  and for which no rebutting arguments have been provided  then do Nis assigned the value Probable     If    is a wff for which a grounded and consistent ar gument has been provided by a participant  and for which neither rebutting nor undercutting arguments have been provided by participants  then do N is as signed the value Confirmed     If    is a logical tautology  then do N is assigned the value Certain   accept prop Pi  propose Pj     do     assert Pi   e do    accept  assert Pi  assert Pj      do    or their equivalents  then the tuple     do  is inserted into CS  Pi   Whenever participant Pi executes a retraction move for      do   the tuple      do is removed fromCS  Pi   Similarly  whenever Piexecutes a Change Modality move for      do   the value of      do in C S  P i is revised  We next define an analogous concept for Nature  with claims inserted into Nature s Commitment Store on the ba sis of the debate at that point in the Agora  This could be achieved in a number of ways  For example  a skeptical community could define Nature s modality for a claim   to be the minimum claim modality assigned by any of those Participants claiming or supporting     A credulous com munity could instead assign to Nature the maximum claim modality assigned by any of the participants to e  Varia tions on these approaches could utilize majority opinion or weighted voting schemes  Because we wish to model dialectical discourse  we have instead chosen to assign Nature s modalities on the basis of the existence of arguments for and against the claim  To do this  we draw on the generic argumentation dictio nary for debates about carcinogenicity of chemicals pre sented in  Krause et al         which is based on Toulmin  s        schema  We begin by defining certain relationships between arguments and then the Claims Dictionary for Na ture  Definition    An argument A  t         G  R      is con sistent if G    eo      e            en      n    en d is consistent  thatis fi there do not exist a     E eo U        U e  u       u u en

community on Nature s behalf to    in accordance with the next two rules   Rule    Nature Commitment Store Update  The entries in CS PN  are updated after each legal move by Agora participants       ARCHITECTURE AND USER INTERFACE  We anticipate the Risk Agora system being used to rep resent a completed or on going scientific debate  but not in real time  Once instantiated with a specific knowledge base in this way  the Agora could be used for a number of differ ent purposes  which led us  McBurney   Parsons        to propose a layered architecture for the Agora  corresponding to these different functions  The main purposes to be ful filled are   a  automated reasoning to find arguments for  and the consequences of  particular claims   b  compari son of the various arguments for and against a claim  and  c  development of an overall case for a claim  coherently combining all the arguments for and against it     AGORA PROPERTIES  The rules defined in the previous section were intended to operationalize the desired Agora properties of Section      We now verify that this is indeed the case  Theorem I  The Agora sy stem defined in Section   has PropertiesP  throughP    Proof  This is straightforward  from the definitions of the   UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS       permitted moves  Thus  Properties P l and P  are fulfilled through the overall system design  Property P  by Rules         and          Property P  by Rules               and      Property P  by Rules                         and       Property P  by Rules          Property P  by Rules         Property P  by Rule      Property P  by Rules   and      and Property P lO by Rule      Moreover  we can use the definition of the claim modalities for Nature provided by Rule   to construct a valuation func tion on wffs and to define a notion of  proof  of claims  as follows  Definition     Natural valuation is afunction v N defined from the set of wffs ofC to the set         such thatv N  B    precisely whendo N   Confirmed  otherwise  vN B          Definition     A provisional proof for a claimB is a grounded and consistent argument forB for which neither rebuttal nor undercutting arguments exist  Our belief in the defeasibility of all scientific claims leads us to use the term  provisional proof  rather than  proof   Likewise  we can think of a natural valuation equal to   as signifying  Currently Accepted as True   or  Defeasibly True   and   as  Not Currently Accepted as True   Our definition of natural valuation thus says that a claim is de feasibly true iff there are no arguments attacking it  We could readily define additional valuation functions which capture degrees of conviction regarding the truth of claims  mapping  for instance  to Probable or to Plausible  With the definitions above  we can now prove soundness of pro visional proofs in the Agora  with respect to the natural valuation function  Theorem    With the notion of provisional proof  theAgora is consistent and complete with respect to theNatural Val uationFunctionvN  provided that all grounded arguments for claims are eventually asserted by someParticipant  Proof  Consistency here says that all claims B for which there exists a provisional proof are also assigned a valu ation of   by the function VN  Completeness says  con versely  that all claims B which are assigned a valuation of   by v N also have a provisional proof  Both of these follow from our definitions of v N and of provisional proof  unless a consistent grounded argument for a claim B exists but is   not asserted by any Participant  The model of science we have adopted asserts that scien tific claims are regarded as  defeasibly true  only when the relevant scientific community agrees to so regard them   After all  even if a transcendent truth exists  science has no privileged means of accessing it   Our definition of nat ural valuation is in effect a proxy for the scientific commu nity s opinion on the truth of a claim  Accordingly  The orem   says that the provisional proof procedure neither under generates nor over generates defeasibly true claims        provided all grounded arguments for claims are eventually asserted     EXAMPLE  To illustrate these ideas we present a simple and hypothet ical example of an Agora debate  In a real debate  partic ipants would be free to introduce supporting evidence and modes of inference at any time  For reasons of space  in this example we first list the statements and modes of inference to be asserted  labeled K l through K   and R l through R   respectively  about a chemical X  Kl  X is produced by the human body naturally  i e  it is endogenous   K   X is endogenous in rats  K   An endogenous chemical is not carcinogenic  K   Bioassay experiments applying X to rats result in sig nificant carcinogenic effects  Rl  And Introduction   Given a wff  and a wff B  we may infer the wff       B    R   Modus Ponens   Given a wff and the wff    B   we may infer the wff B  R   If a chemical is found to be carcinogenic in an ani mal species  then we may infer it to be carcinogenic in humans   We now give an example of an Agora dialogue concern ing the statement  X is carcinogenic to humans  which we denote by   The moves are numbered M l   M         in sequence  and for simplicity we assume the participants are using the claims dictionary of Example    abbreviated to  Cert  Conf  Prob  Plaus  Supp  Open   and the in ference dictionary V     Val  Inval    Before any dis course move is made  Nature s modality for this claim is dq  N   Open  as is its modality for   Ignoring claims about any other chemicals  we thus have at commencement thatCS PN        pen       pen    Through the dialogue  we show the contents of Nature s

that Participant P  in Move MlO  by providing an argument for   K   undercuts the argument presented for   by Participant P  in Move MS  We can also observe the changes in the Natural Valuation of

DISCUSSION  Characterization of scientific discourse as dialectical argu mentation is not new  Rescher         claims to have been the first to propose a dialectical framework for modeling the progress of scientific inquiry  and Pera s        work is also a dialectical approach to science  Among argumen tation theorists  Freeman        also discusses scientific discourse in his study of argument structure  Both Carlson        and Walton and Krabbe        aim to model generic dialogues  but their focus is  respectively  on question and answer and persuasion dialogues  In addition  neither for malism explicitly permits degrees of support for commit ments to be expressed  which our formalism does  None of these works appears intended for encoding in in telligent systems  Within AI  intelligent systems for scien tific domains have used argumentation for some time  e g  Fox  Krause    Ambler        However  these applications have typically involved monolectical rather than dialectical argumentation  More recently  Haggith        developed a dialectical argumentation formalism and applied the re sulting system to a carcinogenicity debate  However  the primary focus of her work was on knowledge representa tion in generic domains of conflict  and so her formalism is not grounded in an explicit philosophy of science  The work of Amgoud  Maudet    Parsons        is closest in approach to that presented here  and we have drawn upon their formalism   but it is focused on negotiation dialogues         agam m a generic context  Their formalism only permits two participants  although this would be relatively easy to amend  As with Haggith s system  their formalism does not permit debate over the rules of inference used  Recent legal argumentation systems  such as those of Verheij          do permit this  Our formal definition of the Risk Agora enables contes tation and defeasibility of scientific claims  Our system therefore operationalizes the two normative principles of conduct for scientific discourses presented in Section      We are currently exploring a number of refinements to the Agora  Firstly  Rehg         has demonstrated the ratio nality of incorporation of rhetorical devices  such as epi deictic speech and appeals to emotions  in dialectical argu ment and decision making  and we seek a means to incor porate such devices in the Agora  This would not be novel  the argumentation system of Reed          for example  al lows for the modeling of rhetorical devices  although in a monolectical context  Secondly  using the Agora in a de liberative context would require incorporation of values for the projected consequences and the development of an ap propriate qualitative decision theory  as in  Fox   Parsons       Parsons   Green        We believe the Risk Agora has a number of potential bene fits  Firstly  by articulating precisely the arguments used to assert carcinogenicity  gaps in knowledge and weaknesses in arguments can be identified more readily  Such iden tification could be used to prioritize bio medical research efforts for the particular chemical  Secondly  by explor ing the logical consequences of claims  the Risk Agora can serve a social maieutic function  making explicit knowl edge which may only be latent  Thirdly  once instantiated with the details of a particular debate  the system could be used for self education by others outside the scientific community concerned  Indeed  it could potentially form the basis for the making of regulatory or societal deci sions on the issues in question  e g  Should the chemical be banned     and thereby give practical effect to notions of deliberative democracy  McBurney   Parsons     a       In press   Finally  with argumentation increasingly being used in the design of multi agent systems  Parsons  Sierra    Jennings        the formalism presented here could readily be adapted for deliberative dialogues between independent software agents  Acknowledgments  This work was partly funded by the British EPSRC under grant GRIL      and a PhD studentship  We also thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments  
  Two solid phases of cyclohexane have been investigated over a temperature range spanning    to     K on a powdered  perdeuterated sample using neutron total scattering  Phase II has an ordered structure  C   c  that forms below     K  Between     and     K it exists as a plastic solid  phase I  Fm m   where the molecules are rotationally disordered about the lattice points of the face centred cubic cell  Data dependent atomistic configurations that represent the instantaneous crystal structure have been generated from the total scattering data using Reverse Monte Carlo refinement  Analysis of local structure reveals that instantaneous distortions in phase I resemble the average structure of phase II   PACS numbers        Uu        fg        Cn   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane        Introduction Understanding the behaviour of matter in the solid state is crucial for the rational development of compounds such as functional materials or pharmaceuticals where intentional induction or prevention of a phase transition is key to the performance of the compound            One approach to understanding this behaviour is through quantification of the relative stabilities of polymorphic crystals  or two structures either side of a phase transition  in terms of interaction energies and or thermodynamic parameters               However by taking this approach  one aspect of phase behaviour is overlooked  how the molecules interact locally  Average structure models  such as those obtained from a typical crystallographic refinement are useful for observing how a material behaves over the duration of data collection  but they do not reveal how the molecules interact at a local level  nor how they influence neighbouring molecules as the substance approaches a phase transition  Neutron total scattering presents an appealing approach for monitoring phase transitions given its capability of simultaneously measuring both the average  crystal  structure and the instantaneous local environment around each atom  With respect to the solid state  the total scattering field has been mostly limited to extended inorganic structures  such as strontium titanate      quartz      cristobalite      and the Pb  Ru  O    oxide pyrochlore       there are comparatively few experiments that focus on molecular systems and even fewer that aim to model the structure from the scattering data  Molecular systems arguably present a greater challenge  given that intermolecular interactions are much weaker than covalent bonds and so each molecule and  by extension  each atom in a molecule is inherently more predisposed towards occupying a wider range of positions  Whilst relatively simple molecular systems such as SF       and CBr       have been studied  where orientational disorder in each of these was reproduced in atomistic models through direct refinement against the scattering data  molecules of increasing complexity are starting to be explored  Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the measured pair distribution functions from amorphous and crystalline forms of carbamazepine and indomethacin have been performed  with the intention of developing a method for fingerprinting amorphous and nanocrystalline pharmaceuticals           One of the challenges posed by large molecules is the difficulty in distinguishing intra from intermolecular contacts between atoms of the same type when they are separated by similar distances  A study of the  terphenyl molecule aimed to tackle this problem by identifying differences in pair distribution function peak shapes to differentiate between intra and intermolecular correlations  This information was used to make adjustments to an atomistic model so as to be consistent with the experimental data       To the best of our knowledge  this study of  terphenyl is the first sizeable organic molecule to be studied using a combined total scattering atomistic modelling approach  Cyclohexane  the focus of this present investigation  is an important molecular system that has also been studied using neutron total scattering               Of   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane     Figure    The structure of cyclohexane in phase II  left  and phase I  right   Only deuterium atoms are visible in phase I   fundamental interest is its thermally induced solid solid phase transition at     K  Below this temperature it exists as an ordered crystalline phase  C   c  hereafter referred to as phase II   whereas between     and     K it is a plastic solid  in which the molecules are rotationally disordered about the lattice points of a FCC cell  Fm m  phase I   The structures of these phases are shown in Figure    The packing arrangement in both phases has been previously identified through single crystal X ray diffraction  where single crystals of the plastic phase were obtained by growth near the transition point  using a zone melting technique       The same study showed that phase I can also been obtained as a plastic crystal glass at    K when quenched  Raman scattering  molecular dynamics  MD  simulations and NMR experiments have all been performed with the aim of identifying the precise nature of the disorder both in phase I and in the liquid above     K                   This was also the intention of a series of neutron total scattering studies which predominantly focussed on the plastic and liquid phases               However  owing to instrument limitations at the time  data were only collected to a Qmax      A    Modern total scattering instruments are now capable of collecting data to much higher resolution  ca     A    which mitigates the effects of Fourier truncation and consequently makes it easier to discern real peaks from Fourier ripples in a real space distribution of interatomic distances  By collecting data to higher resolution  we are able to use the data to drive refinement of   D atomistic models from which orientational and spatial correlation functions can be extracted  The focus on the transformation between phases I and II rather than the melting transition aims to explore the relationship between ordered and disordered phases  The total scattering data reported in this manuscript have been modelled using a Reverse Monte Carlo  RMC       approach  producing atomistic structures that are consistent with both the instantaneous local environment and the average structure  as would be seen by traditional Rietveld refinement  Farman et al suggest that RMC refinement could potentially be used to understand the phase behaviour of cyclohexane further  although they point out that chemically unrealistic atomic configurations are frequently generated       Following advances in RMC software over the last couple of   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane     decades  this is now readily prevented with judicious use of geometry based restraints  We report our analysis of high resolution neutron total scattering data  Qmax        A   for cyclohexane d     over a temperature range spanning phases I and II  From the resulting RMC refined models  we are able to extract correlation functions which reveal translational and rotational relationships between neighbouring pairs of molecules in both phases     Experimental      Sample preparation Cyclohexane d          D   obtained from CDN isotopes  was frozen with liquid nitrogen and cold ground into a homogenous powder at    K  in a nitrogen atmosphere  Details of the cold grinding apparatus are given elsewhere            Neutron total scattering The cyclohexane sample was packed into a thin walled vanadium can and mounted on a CCR device to control the sample temperature  Total scattering data were collected on the General Materials Diffractometer  GEM  at the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source      using the time of flight  ToF  method at the following temperatures                        and     K  The

formalisms is given by Keen       The Bragg contribution to the total scattering patterns was analysed separately using conventional average structure refinement as implemented in GSAS           Rietveld refinement of phase II used the atomic coordinates of the cyclohexane structure deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database with the Refcode CYCHEX as an initial starting model           Refinement was carried out against data collected on all detector banks with exception of the          bank which contained very few Bragg peaks over the accessible range of d  spacing and so was excluded  The fit and data corresponding to the           bank were used to generate the files required for the Bragg profile component in RMC refinement  Rietveld refinement of phase I utilised a Frenkel model  where the cyclohexane molecule was modelled over    orientations  effectively rotating about its centre of mass  Kahn et al found this model gave a marginally better fit to X ray single crystal data than a completely isotropically disordered model       The refinement was carried out against data collected on the           detector bank only  which was then used to generate the files for RMC refinement  Rietveld fits to the data at         and     K are shown in Figure      Local structure correlations in cyclohexane  Figure    Rietveld fits to the phase II data at    and     K and phase I at     K      Local structure correlations in cyclohexane          Starting models for Reverse Monte Carlo refinement Starting models for the RMC refinement at each temperature point were obtained via MD simulations using the DISCOVER software package implemented in Accelrys Materials Studio  The cvff forcefield was used with an NPT ensemble       Simulations were carried out for    ps at intervals of     fs using a Berendsen thermostat and a Parrinello barostat           A         supercell was created for each temperature point  consisting of       atoms  The phase II models were obtained by using the Rietveld refined    K crystal structure as a starting set of coordinates and then performing MD simulations on these at each experimentally measured temperature  The dimensions of the resulting supercells were then manually adjusted to those of the relevant  experimentally observed  crystal structure supercell before undergoing RMC refinement  Construction of the starting models for phase I was a little more elaborate  molecules were manually placed on the FCC lattice points of a cell with P   symmetry and dimensions corresponding to the plastic crystal at     K  The molecules were arbitrarily orientated in positions that appeared visually to be sterically favourable  The geometry was coarsely optimised using DMol        final E          Ha  and then MD simulations on a         supercell were performed  The purpose of the geometry optimisation was to relieve instabilities in the initial cycles of the MD simulation  which were observed if the geometry was not optimised  The resulting supercell was then manually adjusted to have the experimentally observed cell dimensions prior to RMC refinement       Reverse Monte Carlo refinement The program RMCProfile      was used to simultaneously fit calculated F  Q   D r  and Bragg peak intensities to the experimentally observed patterns by randomly moving atoms in the supercell  Moves were accepted based on minimisation of the function  RMC    X   m       m  where  m corresponds to each data set being refined  The individual   functions being minimised were   QF  Q     X     QFcalc  Qj    QFexp

Bragg peaks  fitted as a function of neutron flight time  The  BS and  BB functions are used for geometric restraints  discussed further below   where D is the energy required to break a bond   specifies the curvature of the potential energy function  r  is the specified bond length    is the specified bond angle and K is the bond angle energy term  All moves that decreased the value of   were automatically accepted and those that increased   were accepted within the probability limit P   exp             to avoid becoming trapped in local minima  Refinements of the datasets were carried out until no further improvements in the value of   were seen  requiring ca      accepted moves per atom  In order to generate chemically reasonable atomic configurations  forcefield based distance and angle restraints were imposed on the molecular geometry as otherwise RMCProfile produced erroneous atomic connectivity  Given the rigidity of the cyclohexane molecule  the intramolecular bond distances and angles should not change significantly over the temperature range investigated here and so application of these restraints was quite reasonable  The values used for the bond distances  r  in      and angles    in      were set to those observed in the crystal structure at    K  Dl    and Kl were set to the default values in the MM  database  Closest approach restraints were also employed  preventing DD  CD and CC atom pairs from moving within          and     A of each other respectively  These distances were intentionally set below the realistic closest approach distances seen experimentally           and     A  to try and reduce the level of structural bias introduced into the model as much as possible  For each phase II dataset  RMCProfile used the scale factor determined in the corresponding GSAS refinement to fit the Bragg peak intensities  and this was held fixed for the duration of the run  RMC refinement of the phase I data was more problematic owing to the difficulty in obtaining a reliable scale factor from the Rietveld refinement  as it was strongly correlated with the atomic isotropic thermal parameters  Thus the overall scale factor for the Bragg intensities was also optimised during the RMC refinement       Other programs used Atomic configurations were visualised using CrystalMaker R          and Mercury           Structural figures were created using Atomeye      and Pymol         D correlation   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane     function data were visualised using Paraview       Cambridge Structural Database searches were carried out using CONQUEST with database updates up to May               Results      Initial agreement with data Prior to RMC refinement  D r   F  Q  and Bragg profile patterns were calculated from the starting models and compared with the experimental data  The calculated and experimental D r  data at         and     K are shown in Figure    Across all the temperatures  the MD simulations result in structures that are too strongly correlated at ca  r     A  and at    K  this excessive correlation extends over the entire range of real space being explored  This is likely a consequence of the MD simulations preserving ideal bond lengths  an indication that the bond stretching and bending force constants are too high  However an additional contribution to the peak width in the experimental data at low r also arises from the treatment of the total scattering data itself  as Fourier transformation of the F  Q  data over a finite Q range introduces r dependent peak broadening  At     K there is markedly better agreement between the MD model and experimental data above   A  but at     K the agreement with respect to peak positions is rather poor  particularly between    A  the region corresponding to nearest neighbour interactions       RMCProfile refinement The final RMCProfile fits to the D r   F  Q  and Bragg profile data are shown in Figure   for the data at         and     K  Plots of the final fits to the data at all temperature points investigated can be found in the Supplementary Information  Figure   shows that the fits to all phase II data are generally very good  The D r  plots at r    A change very little as a function of temperature since the major contribution to this region of the pattern is from intramolecular contacts  which are not expected to vary significantly  The intermolecular contacts  the shortest of these being between deuterium atoms  only start to contribute to the D r  above ca      A  A very small degree of peak broadening is present in the low r region  reflecting the effect of thermal energy on the magnitude of bond stretching  Conversely  the region above ca    A exhibits significant peak broadening when temperature is raised  representing increased deviation of the instantaneous molecular positions from those of the average positions  This can be solely ascribed to intermolecular contacts given that the longest intramolecular distance is ca    A between the equatorial deuterium atoms on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring  We make a brief comment here regarding the use of the D r  normalisation in RMC refinement  Preliminary refinements with the same data and constraints  not reported   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane     Figure    Initial level of agreement between the experimental D r  data and the simulated MD models at         and     K   here  were performed with the G r  normalisation instead  It was found that although satisfactory fits were obtained for all data  when these fits were recalculated with D r  it was apparent that the phase I atomic configurations did not adequately reflect the experimental D r  at large r       A   This had the effect that phase I models with some remnant artificial orientational periodicity could still yield good fits to the data  Returning to the fits in Figure    the difference between phase I and phase II most obviously manifests itself in the Bragg profile data  there are only three significant Bragg peaks sat on a large background of modulated diffuse scattering  which is consistent with the onset of rotational disorder in the structure  This point is also clearly evident in the very diffuse peaks in the D r  above   A and the disappearance of peaks in the F  Q   Below   A  the D r  data are similar to phase II as the connectivity of the molecule remains unchanged  The positions of the broad features in the D r   corresponding to intermolecular correlations  in the     K data are comparable with those reported by Farman at     K                  and      A in our data c f                  and      A in Farmans data        It was noted by Farman that the first purely intermolecular peak at     A is at lower r than might be expected as the        A FCC cell edge means that the shortest   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      Figure    RMC fits to the D r

range can be found in the S I  The Bragg profile data at     K have been scaled up by a factor of    to be visually comparable with the other data  contact between molecular centroids should be ca       A  In our data  the apex of this very diffuse peak  which ranges between      and      A actually appears at an even shorter distance of      A  This all points toward an increased need for neighbouring molecules to interact in a correlated manner whereby molecular orientations are coupled to nearest neighbour separation distances  Aside from peaks in the D r  that can be attributed to intramolecular contacts  there are additional peaks at longer r      A  common to both phases that only differ in position by a maximum of ca      A  It is known from the earlier neutron total scattering experiments      that the structure of the plastic phase is dependent on the thermal history of the sample and so this suggests that even though the phase I structure may appear rotationally disordered  there are strong local correlations present similar to those seen in phase II       Distribution of atomic positions In order to gain a clear picture of the atomic site distribution across all temperatures     RMC refinements were carried out at each temperature point  and the resulting   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      Figure    Comparison of the instantaneous distribution of carbon atoms with the average crystal structures as viewed along the c axis at     left        centre  and     K  right   Thermal ellipsoids in the lower row are displayed at the     level  Deuterium atoms are omitted for clarity  The two phases are not shown to scale with respect to each other and so cell constants have been included  The origin of the unit

uncertainties in derived parameters such as correlation functions  Figure   shows the distribution of carbon atom positions in the unit cell as a function of temperature  compared with the thermal ellipsoids of the average crystal structure plotted at the     probability level  In the interest of improved statistical significance all subsequent analysis reported here has been carried out on this ensemble of    RMC configurations for each temperature  In phase II  the distribution of carbon atoms closely resembles the anisotropic displacement parameters in the Rietveld refined crystal structure  reproducing the effects of increasing temperature on atomic position  In phase I  the distribution of atoms about each lattice point is approximately spherical although the fit to the Bragg profile data is not as good as that of phase II  the intensity of one peak is underfitted and another over fitted  We ascribe this to the probable challenge presented to the RMC process by the model itself  The combination of close molecular packing and minimum distance constraints may make it difficult to rotate a molecule  as it necessarily requires other neighbouring molecules to rotate in a cooperative manner  Thus  the final molecular orientations are more likely the result of the MD simulations instead  Evidence for this is presented in the Discussion  However  the RMC process greatly improves upon the separation distances between molecules  as shown by the initially poor agreement between the calculated and experimental D r s  Figure    and the excellent agreement obtained when fitted  Figure     Whilst the refined distribution of carbon atoms mostly   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      conforms to the FCC symmetry restrictions  there are numerous carbon atoms that are not located within one of the four main sites of atomic distribution  shown in Figure    These correspond to a few molecules in each of the datasets that have moved away from the FCC sites during the RMC refinement  These spatial deviations may not be structurally unrealistic given that the position of the first intermolecular peak in the D r  appears at a shorter distance than the smallest intermolecular separation in the average structure     Discussion      Correlated motion In phase I each molecule should not be able to tumble independently of its nearest neighbours  simply because there is insufficient space to do so       In order for a molecule to tumble  the closest molecules must spatially accommodate it  but this necessarily has implications for successive shells of nearest neighbours  An advantage of fitting an atomistic model to the data presents itself here  namely features such as the spatial distribution of molecules and their orientations can be extracted  An initial assessment of intermolecular D      D contacts shows that the vast majority of molecules do not move unfavourably close to one another  avoiding the occurrence of contacts below     A  the closest approach distance for intermolecular hydrogen atoms identified by Wood et al      for small organic molecules up to pressures of    GPa  A small number of molecules approach each other at distances as low as     A  the lowest limit permitted by the RMC refinement  Figure   shows a radial distribution function of the contacts as a function of temperature  clearly showing that these unrealistic supershort distances are the exception rather than the rule  where the real minimum distance actually appears to be closer to ca      A instead  Since the majority of molecules obey the     A limit  this immediately shows pairwise correlated motion exists to some extent  In order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the orientational correlations between pairs of molecules  we proceeded to analyse the RMC configurations purely in terms of the orientation of each cyclohexane ring and the location of its centre of mass  For convenience  we represent the orientations as vectors S oriented normal to the mean plane of the cyclohexane ring  noting that all subsequent calculations are invariant with respect to inversion  Figure   shows representative sections of the atomic configurations at         and     K with the vectors represented by doubleended red arrows to reflect this inversion invariance  Orientational correlations between cyclohexane molecules can then be quantified by the correlation function      SS      Here S and S  represent the individual molecular orientations for any given pair of neighbouring molecules  The value of  is equal to   where the molecules are parallel and      when they are perpendicular to one another  Given the likelihood that the molecular orientations are strongly coupled to separation distance  the relative spatial positions of each molecular pair were also considered through definition of a centroid   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      Figure    Partial radial distribution function for

the development of thermal disorder in the structure but the retention of the same basic structure and correlations  In phase I   Figures  c and  d  the molecules exhibit a far wider range of orientations  and so there is a blue isosurface  representing  values between   and    in addition to the red  At each extreme end of the blue surface  if  Sr      then  S  r       and vice versa  The corresponding orientations are depicted in Figure   by the equivalent scenarios    and    The edges of the blue isosurface have a low  r  value of     A  whereas at intermediate values of  Sr  and  S  r   ca             the isosurface does not fall below     A except for a small protrusion in the centre that reaches     A  This shows that when converting between scenarios   and   the molecules must move further apart in order to spatially accommodate the rotation  That this conversion section covers a relatively small region of the   D histogram suggests that fewer molecules prefer to adopt the orientation where both molecules make an angle of ca     with the centroid centroid vector  This may represent something akin to an orientational transition state between the presumably sterically favoured edge to face   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      Figure     Nearest neighbours to a central reference molecule in phase II  Panels a to d show neighbouring molecules at

overall  r  range that the blue isosurface covers  ca           A  corresponds to pairwise correlations between molecules in the corner of the unit cell and at the face centre  The red isosurface in Figures  c and  d is less evenly distributed  where only a small proportion of molecules align with their neighbour and also with their centroidcentroid vector  numbered   in the Figure  Significantly more molecules prefer to be anywhere between being perpendicular to the centroid centroid vector  numbered    or making an angle of ca      with it  The smaller region of the red surface reaches low  r  values of     A  which is significantly shorter than the corner to face distance seen in the average structure  cf      A   demonstrating that in order for two molecules to move this close together they must adopt a geometric arrangement resembling scenario   in Figure    This distorted geometry bears similarity to the molecular pair arrangement in phase II with the shortest separation distance        A at     K   represented by Figure   a  The larger of the red regions in Figures  c and  d lies between  r        and     A  a much shorter distance than the cubic cell dimension of        A  This region is most easily considered in two parts  the first at shorter  r  corresponding to molecules that are approximately located on their average positions in the corner and face centre   Local

along the bottom row  The blue isosurface at     K has been removed for clarity   of the unit cell  The second part  at longer  r  can be attributed to molecules that have deviated from their average positions where the face centre molecules move further away from the cell origin  When this far apart  the molecules experience reduced steric hindrance from each other and so are able to adopt a geometry more closely resembling scenario   in Figure    Similarly to the smaller red region in Figures  c and  d  the distortion from the average structure results in local environments that are reminiscent of the average molecular packing seen in phase II  where the molecules are       A  Figure   c  and       A  Figure   d  apart within the ab plane  A visual comparison of the red isosurfaces at     and     K shows that they enclose a broadly similar region of the   D histogram  Figure      This is consistent with the observations  discussed above  that instantaneous structural distortions in phase I result in local geometry that is more like the average structure of phase II than I  Although it is harder to identify local features in the phase II models that suggest transformation into phase I is developing within the structure  other than increased thermal motion   it is much easier to see how phase I might transform into II  The main difference between the regions of red isosurface in the two phases is their relative sizes  however the area of phase I is necessarily reduced owing to a significant quantity of molecules being able to adopt the perpendicular geometries as a result of the rotational disorder       Molecular orientation distribution The unit cell vectors of phases I and II are related by the transformation       a           a

the monoclinic c axis  parallel to the       direction in the cubic phase   The distance between molecular centroids changes such that the density in the       plane decreases but these layers approach one another more closely in the       direction  We have examined the distribution of molecular orientations in both phases  plotted in Figure     where the monoclinic cell axes have been transformed to the cubic axis system and had m m symmetry applied to the orientational distribution to aid comparison with phase I  Additionally shown in Figure    are the orientational distributions for the results of the MD simulations  i e  the starting atomic coordinates for RMC refinement  The imposition of cubic symmetry generates symmetry equivalent peaks for both data and noise and so it is important not to place too much significance on fine details in the plots  In phase II the molecular orientations align preferentially along the h   i directions  with respect to the cubic axes  at    K and as temperature is raised to     K  although the distribution of orientations increases  the preferred orientations are still along h   i  This set of directions corresponds to the c axis in the monoclinic cell setting  showing that the molecules are in a favourable orientation to transform  The plots for phase I are shown on a different scale to phase II as otherwise they appear to show a random distribution of molecular orientations  potentially masking any subtle structural features  However  rescaling the data also enhances the level of noise and so we tentatively interpret the plots as showing that the molecular orientations are not spherically distributed  but instead preferentially align along the h   i directions  However further work needs to be carried out to unambiguously establish whether the preferential alignment with the h   i directions in phase I is a real feature or not       Molecular dynamics informed refinements Of particular note in Figure    is that across the whole temperature range there is very little difference between the distribution of molecular orientations in the MD and RMC models  In phase II  there is not a strong need for the RMC refinement to alter the molecular orientations significantly from those defined by the MD simulations  They are evidently in good agreement with the data to begin with as the refined orientations show little change  yet the fits to the D r   F  Q  and Bragg profile data  Figure    are excellent  In phase I  although the overall agreement between the RMC refined models and the data is still very good  a couple of peak intensities in the Bragg profile are overand under fitted  The suggestion was put forward earlier in this manuscript that the disordered cyclohexane models might be challenging for RMC refinement as all molecules would need to be moved cooperatively  Indeed  this can be demonstrated more clearly when starting from an initially ordered model where the molecules have been placed arbitrarily on the face centres of the unit cell but are all oriented in the same direction  Figure    shows the RMC fits and the atomic site and molecular orientation distributions   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      Figure     Molecular orientation distributions plotted against cubic axes  the directions of which are shown in the upper left plot  The left and right halves of each distribution correspond to the post MD  and post RMC orientations respectively  Light colours represent the directions perpendicular to which the mean cyclohexane planes are oriented  The bar on the lower left shows the scale on which the data are plotted and the phase is given in parentheses   for such a model  having been refined for the same period of time as the other phase I structures reported here  The atomic distribution shows that the final model does not meet the FCC symmetry requirements and is accompanied by poor fits to the data  In particular  the additional erroneous peaks in the Bragg profile fit show a lowering of the average symmetry  A representative overall   value     taken from one of the    refined models is        over twice the value obtained when starting from the MD coordinates          suggesting that the model is either jammed in a local minimum or the refinement is very slow to converge  It may be the case that a satisfactory model could be obtained if the refinement were allowed to continue for a greater period of time but this becomes impractical when a reasonable structure can be reached much faster when the MD simulations are utilised  This highlights the usefulness of combining RMC with other techniques  MD in this case  for arriving at a structure that is consistent with the experimental total scattering data  Other examples in the literature have also demonstrated that RMC refinements for problematic systems arrive at more sensible structures when aided by complementary information from other techniques           Cyclohexane is arguably another challenging example as the correlated motion has to be dealt with as well as preservation of the relatively complex molecular geometry  in the context of other RMC refined systems   Here  the role of the MD is to deal with the orientations of the molecules  and the RMC to broaden this distribution  The more significant outcome of the RMC refinement is that the

systems to have been attempted with the RMC method in terms of the molecular geometry and complexity of intermolecular steric interactions  From the resulting atomic configurations   D correlation functions have been extracted for both phases that confirm molecular orientation is coupled to spatial distribution  Similar local packing is observed in both phases  and features from the average structure of phase II are seen to exist locally in instantaneously distorted regions of phase I  Plots of molecular orientation distributions have shown that the molecular arrangements are largely defined by the MD simulations and that the distributions of orientations are then broadened by the RMC refinements  The main contribution   Local structure correlations in cyclohexane      of the RMC process to the resulting atomic configurations is to refine the molecular separation distances such that they show excellent agreement with the experimental data across all the investigated
