 We investigate an approach to reasoning about causes through argumentation  We consider a causal model for a physical system  and look for arguments about facts  Some arguments are meant to provide explanations of facts whereas some challenge these explanations and so on  At the root of argumentation here  are causal links   A         An   causes B  and ontological links  o  is a o     We present a system that provides a candidate explanation   A         An   explains  B         Bm    by resorting to an underlying causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological links  Argumentation is then at work from these various explaining links  A case study is developed   a severe storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in       with an unaccountably high number of casualties      Introduction and Motivation  Looking for explanations is a frequent operation  in various domains  from judiciary to mechanical fields  We  consider the case where we have some precise  not necessarily exhaustive  description of some mechanism  or situation  and we are looking for explanations of some facts  The description contains logical formulas  plus some causal and ontological formulas  or links   Indeed  it is known that  while there are similarity between causation and implication  causation cannot be rendered by a simple logical implication  Also  confusing causation and co occurrence could lead to undesirable relationships  This is why we use here a causal formalism where some causal links and ontological links are added to classical logical formulas  Then the causal formalism will produce various explanation links      However  if the situation described is complex enough  this will result in a great number of possible explanations  and some argumentation is involved in order to get some reasons to choose between all these candidate explanations  In this text  we will consider as an example a severe storm  called Xynthia  which made    deaths in a single group of houses in La Faute sur Mer  a village in Vendee during a night in February       This was a severe storm  with strong winds  low pressure  but it had been forecast  Since the casualties were excessive with respect to the strength of the meteorological phenomenon  various investigations have been ordered  This showed that various factors combined their effects  The weather had its role  however  other factors had been involved   recent houses and a fire station had been constructed in an area known as being susceptible of getting submerged  Also  the state authorities did not realize that asking people to stay at home was inappropriate in case of flooding given the traditionally low Vendee houses  In this paper  we define in section   an enriched causal   model  built from a causal model and an ontological model  We then show in section   how explanations can be derived from this enriched causal model  We explain in section   the use of argumentation in order to deal with the great number of possible explanations obtained and conclude in section    The Xynthia example  introduced in section    is used as illustration throughout the article           simply means that  can be deduced from  due to specialiis a zation generalization links  the  links in the ontological model  that relate the classes of objects mentioned in  and ded ont   Note that the relation  is transitive and reflexive  Here is an easy illustration  A sedan is a kind of car  is a which is represented by sedan  car in the ontological ded ont model  Then  Iown sedan   Iown car  is an ontological deduction link in the enriched model  ded ont Technically  the  links among literals are generated by means of a single principle as follows  The predicates used in the causal model are annotated so that each of their parameters is sorted either as universal or as existential  A universal parameter of a predicate inherits by specialization  meaning that if the predicate is true on this parameter then the predicate is also true for specializations of this parameter  The existential parameters of a predicate inherits by generalization  meaning that if a the predicate is true on this parameter  then the predicate is also true for generalizations of this parameter  cf above example of our owner of a sedan   As another example  consider the unary predicate Flooded  where Flooded o  means that class o  an area or a group of buildings  is submerged  Its unique parameter is taken to be universal so that if the literal Flooded o  is true  then the literal Flooded s  is also true whenever s is a specialization of o  The causal model ded ont is enriched by adding Flooded o   Flooded s  for is a each class s satisfying s  o  Let us now consider the unary predicate Occurs so that Occurs Hurri  intuitively means   some hurricane occurs  Exactly as above I own predicate  this predicate is existential on its unique parameter  By means of is a is a the  link Hurri  SWind  we obtain the following ded ont ded ont  link   Occurs Hurri   Occurs SWind   ded ont Let us provide the formal definition of  links in the case of unary predicates  Then  the general case is a natural  but intricate and thus ommitted here  generalization of the unary case   Enriched causal model   Causal model   ontological model  The model that is used to build tentative explanations and support argumentation  called the enriched causal model  is built from a causal model relating literals in causal links  and from an ontological model where classes of objects are related through specialization generalization links       The causal model  By a causal model      we mean a representation of a body of causal relationships to be used to generate arguments that display explanations for a given set of facts  The basic case is that of a causal link  causes  where  and  are literals  In this basic case   stands for the singleton    as the general case of a causal link is the form               n   causes  where             n   is a set  interpreted conjunctively  of literals  Part of the causal model for our Xynthia example is given in Fig     each plain black arrow represents a causal link        The ontological model  The literals P  o    o         ok   occurring in the causal model use some predicates P applied to classes of objects oi   The ontological model consists of specialization generalization links between classes of objects is a  o   o    is a  where  denotes the usual specialization link between is a classes  E g   we have Hurri  SWind  House FPA is a is a  HouseFPA and HouseFPA  BFPA   a hurricane  Hurri  is a specialization of a strong wing  SWind   and the class of low houses with one level only in the flood prone area  House FPA  is a specialization of the class of houses in the flood prone area  HouseFPA   which itself is a specialization of the class of buildings in this area  BFPA   A part of the ontological model for our Xynthia example is given in Fig     each white headed arrow labelled with is a represents an is a  link    The enriched causal model  The causal model is extended by resorting to the ontological model  and the result is called the enriched causal model  The enrichment lies in the so called ontological deded ont duction links  denoted    between literals  Such a link ded ont      Definition   Let us suppose that P rop  and P rop  are two unary predicates  of the existential kind for the first one  and of the universal kind for the second one  If in the is a ontology is the link class   class    then the following two links are added to the enriched model   ded ont P rop   class     P rop   class    and ded ont P rop   class     P rop   class       ded ont  In our formalism  causal and ontological links  entail classical implication   Vn         n   causes  entails   i   i          ded ont    entails     Ordinary logical formulas are also allowed  for example for describing exclusions   which are added to the formulas coming from      When resorting to explanations  see section   below   ded ont these  links are extended to sets of literals  links denoont ted by ded   as follows   set Definition   Let  and  be two sets of literals  we define ont  ded   if for each     there exists    such set ded ont ded ont that     remind that       The following predicates are introduced    Flooded  and  Victims I  applied to a group of building respectively meaning that flooding occurs over this group  and that there were victims in this group  I            is a degree of gravity  e g  Victims    Victims   and Victims   respectively mean  in   of the population of the group   a small number  a significant number and a large number of victims   OK means that its unique parameter is in a normal state  Occurs means that some fact has occurred  a strong wind  a disaster          Expected means that some fact is expected to occur  All these predicates are universal on their unique parameter  except for the predicates Occurs and Expected which are existential   is a  Notice that if a sedan is a kind of car  sedan  car   and Own a predicate existential on its unique argument  ont then we get  Iown sedan   IamHappy  ded set  Iown car   IamHappy   and ont  Iown car     Iown sedan   IamHappy  ded set  Note that negation of a literal is expressed by Neg as in Neg OK Anemo  meaning that the anemometer is not in its normal behaviour state  the formula  OK Anemo    NEG OK anemo   is thus added       The classes and the ontological model are given in Fiis a gure   with the  links

consider in the ontological model and or in the causal model are the following ones   Hurri  SWind  BFPA  House FPA  HouseFPA  and BFPA have already been introduced in      together with a is a few

restrict ourselves to Very low pressure  VLPress   together with already seen Hurri and SWind  and finally we add high spring tide  HSTide  to our list of classes  Two kinds of alerts  Alert  may be

explanation links  We want to exhibit candidate reasons that can explain a fact by means of at least one causal link  We disregard explanations that involve only links of the implicational kind  Here is how causal and ontological links are used in our formalism   Let  denote a set of literals and  be a literal  The basic case is that  causes  yields that  can be explained by    We want also that our explanation links can follow ded ont  links as follows  in the case where       is a singleton  thus we note sometimes  instead of            can explain  provided  is possible ded ont ded ont

set yields that   can explain   provided  is possible Now  we also want that our explanation links are transitive  and this necessitates to be able to explain not only   literals  but sets of literals  Thus we introduce explanation links among sets of literals  which extend our explanation links from sets of literals towards literals  since it is an extension  we can keep the same name explanation link         Explaining a set of literals from a set of literals  Definition   Let n be some natural integer  and  for i              n    i be sets of literals and i be literals  If  for each i              n   we have  can explain i provided i is possible  then we define the following  set  explanation link  can explain  S i  i              n   n provided i   i is possible  Again  such an explanation link Sn applies only when its  full  justification set  here   i   i   is possible  not contradicted by the data   Notice that we do not want to explain  by  itself  and ont links   we extend this restriction to ded set We do not want to explain  by   is all we know is ont   Indeed  this seems to be cheating about what   ded set an explanation is  we want some causal information to play a role   However  in the line of      we want that explanations ont links  thus we introduce the following definifollow ded set tion   Definition   If we have      can explain  provided  is possible ont ont     ded   ded set set then we have   can explain   provided  is possible Again  the full justification set of the resulting explaining link is      Our last definition of  set  explanation links concerns transitivity of explanations  This is a weak transitivity since the justifications are gathered  however  we will call this property transitivity  We need to be able to omit in the resulting link the part of the intermediate set which is already explained in the first explanation giving rise to a transitive link   Definition   If      can explain      provided   is possible and     can explain  provided   is possible  then    can explain        provided      is possible  Again  the full justification set is                  About explanation links and arguments  As a small example  let us suppose that in the causal model is the link reason causes P rop  class    and that in the ontology are the links   is a class   class  is a class   class  Resulting are the next two links in the enriched model   ded ont P rop  class     P rop  class    ded ont P rop  class     P rop  class    By pattern matching over the diagrams in Fig    and    cf patterns     and      we get reason can explain P rop  class    through P rop  class     justification   Importantly  it is assumed that the causal link is expressed on the appropriate level   in other words  should there be some doubts about the kind of objects  here class    that enjoy P rop due to reason  the causal link would be about another class  The proviso accompanying the explanation takes place at the level of justifications   the candidate explanation is worth inasmuch as P rop  class    is not contradicted  In particular it must be consistent with the reason causing P rop  class     remind       Here is an example from Xynthia data  Consider the causal link Expected V LP ress  causes Expected SW ind  together with the following ontological links     is a Hurri  SW ind is a  Hurri   N atDis   The links below can be obtained in the enriched model     ded ont Expected Hurri   Expected SW ind  ded ont Expected Hurri   Expected N atDis  We get an argument to the effect that from the set of data     Expected V LP ress  causes Expected SW ind  ded ont Expected Hurri   Expected StrW     ded ont Expected Hurri   Expected N atDis  we obtain     yields that  Expected V LP ress  can explain Expected N atDis  provided Expected Hurri  is possible  The intuition is that  from these data  it is reasonable to explain Expected N atDis   by Expected V LP ress     provided Expected Hurri  is possible  not contradicted by other data        An example of compound explanations  Figure   displays an example from Xynthia  cf also Fig     of a few possible explanations  represented by dotted lines  with their label such as   or  a  The sets of literals  from which the explaining links start  are framed and numbered from     to      This shows transitivity of explanations at work   e g  set   can

VLPress       get any alarm  However  this counter argument may itself be attacked by remarking that  in the case of a hurricane  that is a kind of strong wind  an anemometer is no longer operating  which can explain that a red alarm cannot be observed  Let us see how to consider formally argumentation when relying on an enriched causal model and explanations as described in sections   and    Of course  we begin with introducing arguments  as follows      a    Occurs StWind  Occurs HSTide        Occurs F looding   causes F looded BF P A   Occurs V LP ress    Occurs SW ind  causes Occurs F

explanations for assertions and these explanations might be used in an argumentative context         Let us first provide some motivation from our example  A possible set of explanations for the flooded buildings is constituted by the bad weather conditions  very low pressure and strong wind  together with high spring tide  see Fig      Given this explanation  argument   it is possible to attack it by noticing   a strong wind is supposed to trigger the red alarm of my anemometer and I did not  More precisely  using the basic case     twice  we obtain that F looded BF P A  can be explained by the set of literals    Occurs V LP ress   Occurs SW ind      Occurs HST ide  The corresponding argument is  yields that  can be explained by   provided  is possible where  The explanation is    The statement being explained is  F looded BF P A    The justification of the explanation is empty   The evidence is             Counter arguments  Generally speaking  an argument  can explain  in view of   provided  is possible is challenged by any statement which questions    either   e g   an argument exhibiting an explanation V for the negation of      or   e g   an argument exhibiting an explanation for the negation of      or   e g   an argument exhibiting an explanation for V the negation of      or any item in   e g   an argument exhibiting an explanation for the negation of  for some  occurring in      or does so by refutation   using any of      and  to explain some falsehood  Such objections are counter arguments  they have the form of an argument   they explain something but what they explain contradicts something in the challenged argument   Dispute  Let us consider the illustration at the start of this section   The argument  that the buildings in the flood prone area are flooded can be explained  partly  by a strong wind  is under attack on the grounds that my anemometer did not turn red indicating that no strong wind occurred  The latter is a counter argument of type   in above list  Indeed  the statement to be explained by the counter argument is the falsehood Red anemo   e g   Green Anemo  has been observed   using SW ind  i e   an item in the explanation in the attacked argument  Remember  the attacked argument is  P A  can be explained by   yields that F looded BF  Occurs V LP ress   Occurs SW ind    Occurs HST ide  Taking Red Anemo  to be a falsehood  the counterargument at hand is can be explained by    yields that Red anemo    Occurs SW ind  OK Anemo  where  The explanation is      Occurs SW ind   OK Anemo     The statement being explained is      Red Anemo    The evidence is            Occurs SW ind  causes Red anemo  OK Anemo  In our illustration  this counter argument has in turn a counter argument  of type     explaining why the anemometer did not get red   i e   explaining the negation of an  item  OK Anemo  is the item in question  in the explanation in the counter argument  So  the counter counterargument here is    yields that   OK Anemo  can be explained by Occurs Hurri  where  The explanation is       Occurs Hurri     The statement being explained is       OK Anemo    The evidence is       Occurs Hurri  causes OK Anemo   The dispute can extend to a counter counter counterargument and so on as the process iterates      Conclusion  The aim of this work is to study the link between causes and explanations         and to rely on explanations in an argumentative context      In a first part  we define explanations as resulting from both causal and ontological links  An enriched causal model is built from a causal model and an ontology  from which the explaining links are derived  cf e g  Fig  and      Our work differs from other approaches in the literature in that it strictly separates causality  ontology and explanations  while considering that ontology is key in generating sensible explanations from causal statements  Note however that some authors have already introduced ontology to be used for problem solving tasks as planning     Chapter    and more recently for diagnosis and repair      We then argue that these causal explanations are interesting building blocks to be used in an argumentative context  Although explanation and argumentation have long been identified as distinct processes       it is also recognized that the distinction is a matter of context  hence they both play a role     when it comes to eliciting an answer to a why question  This is exactly what is attempted in this paper  as we are providing possible explanations  that thus can be turned into arguments  The argument format has some advantages inasmuch as its uniformity allows us to express objection in an iterated way   possible explanations are challenged by counter arguments that happen to represent rival  or incompatible  possible explanations  However  a lot remains to be done  Among others  comparing competing explanations according to minimality  preferences  and generally a host of criteria  We have designed a system in answer set programming that implements most of the explicative proposal introduced above  We plan to include it in an argumentative framework and think it will a good basis for a really practical system  able to manage with a as rich and tricky example as the full Xinthia example    References     Philippe Besnard

  We propose an integration of possibility the ory into non classical logics  We obtain many formal results that generalize the case where possibility and necessity functions are based on classical logic  We show how useful such an approach is by applying it to reasoning un der uncertain and inconsistent information     IRIT Paul Sabatier     route de Narbonne        Toulouse Cedex France  U niversite  Now  possibility theory brings in something more that should be fruitfully exploited as complementary to such aspects of reasoning  Hence  we study how to integrate possibility theory with non classical logics  Our work comes from the following two facts    even when the involved uncertainty has a possi bilistic nature   classical  possibility theory may not be well suited to the addressed problem  due to shortcomings  not of possibility theory itself but of classical logic  on which possibility theory is defined  For example  some problems require a formalization with a local view of inconsistency  this is impossible with classical possibility theory  we need a paraconsistent approach  cfSection        on the ot her hand  non standard logics su ch as intuitionistic logic  paraconsistent logics       are not expressive enough to express uncertainty in a gradual way   Introduction  Possibility theory has been widely used in Artificial In telligence to represent uncertain knowledge in a more qualitative way than  for example  probability theory  indeed  it is equivalent to work with  quantitative  possibility theory  which means using possibility and necessity measures and possibility distributions  which map formulas or worlds to         or with its qualitative counterpart  where qualitative necessity and possibil ity relations are preorders on the logical language and qualitative possibility distributions are just preorders on the set of worlds   Besides  its connection to vari ous qualitative formalisms in logic and Artificial Intel ligence has been established  notably with epistemic entrenchment relations in  DP  la   conditional logics in  Bou      F HL      System Z in  BDP      The use of possibility theory in Artificial Intelligence covers non monotonic reasoning  DP   b   belief revision  incon sistency handling  inheritance and default rules han dling  temporal reasoning  constraint satisfaction        In Knowledge Representation  many non classical log ics have been used  note that in this paper we consider only non classical logics sharing the same language as classical logic   Each of them was intended for some particular focus  a specific aspect of reasoning  E g  paraconsistent logics have been used to deal with con tradictory knowledge bases  Or  intuitionistic logic has been used to take into account some subtle distinctions between statements involving double negation for ex ample  Or  Kleene s   valued logic  and other many valued logics  has been used to cope with statements for which neither truth nor falsity make sense   These arguments show that it is generally valuable to integrate non classical logics with a numerical theory of uncertainty  Now  the reason why we focus in this paper on possibility theory rather than another theory of uncertainty  is its qualitative nature  as it amounts to a  numerical account  of preordering relations over formulas or worlds   which should make it a priori sim pler to generalize than more quantitative approaches such as probability theory or belief functions  The methodology we follow in this paper consists of going from the general case to the particular case    in Section    we investigate whether  and under which conditions  important properties of possi bility theory remain valid when generalized  We state the results in the most general case to make the study  reusable   though the applications de veloped in Section   focus on paraconsistency     in Section    we take a case study  that is  we choose a paraconsistent logic  namely Ct  and dis cuss more practical applications to reasoning with uncertain and inconsistent information    Research supported by CNRS in proj ect  Gestion de l evolutif et l incertain dans une ba  e de

see  Zad     for instance  shows that pos sibility theory consists in meta level definitions over classical logic  which respect completely the structure of classical logic  This suggests that similar functions could be defined on other logics than classical logic  so  replacing   C I   by   C  f   L  where L is a given non classical logic  we can look for a definition of possibility necessity functions on the logic L  We deal with classical propositional  languages  built from a list of propositional variables   sometimes required to be finite    and the connec tives         V         where   L        t   is a shorthand for   L      t   and   L t           The only vary ing parameter is then the consequence relation f L  We now give a generic definition of non classical ne cessity  possibility functions  of which the usual ne cessity  possibility functions correspond to the special case where L is classical logic  Section   deals with the special case where L is the paraconsistent logic Cr    Definition  let  C be a classical propositional language and   L a consequence relation  L being a given  maybe non classical  logic  A L necessity function is a map ping N from  C to        satisfying the following axioms   Taut  if  f   L    N      then        The dual functions of necessity functions are called possibility functions  They can be defined by   axioms about contradiction  equivalence and disjunction   Definition  A L possibility from C to        such that  function is a mapping II   Contr  if   L     then II         Eqn  if l  L       t   then II

Eqrr  and  Disj  on condition that f  L satisfies    L              Some properties of non classical necessity  possibility functions  W hen L is classical logic   L  possibility functions can be defined from  L  necessity functions by means of  lip E   ll lf        N     r p  and  L  necessity func tions can be defined from  L  possibility functions by V  J E  C N        II      That is   classical  neces sity and possibility functions enjoy the  double  dual ity property   Dl  II is a possibility function iff d n              defined by drr  r p     II     P  is a necessity func tion   D   N is a necessity function iff dN   C           de fined by dN         N      is a possibility func tion      Eq  if   L        t   then N  P    N t     Conj  N      t      min N     N t     When L is classical logic  we recover the classical ne cessity functions  Whatever the logic L is  the follow ing property always entails  Eq    Dom  if f   L  P   t   then N  P     N  t     Some questions we may ask are  how can  D   and  D   carry over to L necessity and L possibility func tions  When are  Dl  and  D   equivalent   Proposition     Dom  is entailed by  Eq  and  Conj   Proposition    if

reflects    a degree of  partial  inconsistency  Note that requiring  Contr  or not  and the same for  Taut   does not make much difference since  Dam  ensures that contradictions  resp  tautologies  have anyway the lowest  resp  highest  necessity degree  Now  the reason why we require  Taut  and not  Contr  concerns the characterization of necessity functions in terms of possibility

Let us now have a look on necessary conditions for having  D    or  D      Proposition    if there exists   such that f L r p and r p then  Dl  does not hold  IfL        Possibility and Necessity

under which a function from C to        can be both a necessity and a possibility function  a truth functional valuation is a fun c tion f from C to        such that there exist two non  Definition

there are two values O  and    such that Vip   IP  E  o l   and f   IP  f  f IP It is well know n that trivialisation of truth functional va luations holds in the case of classical propositional logic   Wes      DP       see also  DP     for a discus sion on the implications of this result   To study the condition under which this property also holds in the case of non classical logics  Je t us

paper as well as sup         It can then be proved that N is a necessity measure  and that any necessity measure is induced by a possibility distribution  We now turn to the general case of a logic L

expressed in purely qualitative terms  with preordering relations  We briefly give a generalization of this result  for the case of necessities  the case for possibilities is similar   Definition  A   necessity ordering is a relation on  C satisfying the following properties   rp                   then rp       transitivity          rp  dominance  or rp    tjJ     J  conjunctiveness     if    if I

Definition  Proposition     correspondence between   necessity functions and   necessity orderings   the only map pings from  C to        agreeing strictly with   necessity orderings and also satisfying  Taut  are   necessity functions      Application to reasoning with uncertain and inconsistent information       Motivations  Possibility theory  as well as its qualitative counter parts such as epistemic entrenchment relations  GM      ranked knowledge bases  Pea     or rational clo sure   eh     provide a relativized treatment of incon sistency  since the latter becomes a gradual notion  I e   a possibilistic knowledge base  D P     consists of a set of constraints KB     cp  ai  i   l  n   where  cp  a   is a syntactic notation for the semantical con straint N rp       a    A possibilistic knowledge base is partially inconsis tent if it leads to enforce N  l       stated oth erwise  the inconsistency degree of K B is defined by Incons KB    maxs KB Sl  min  p a  es a    min N  l   N satisfies KB   Any formula below this level  i e  any rp  where a      Incons KB   is then in hibited  it is  drown  by the inconsistency  BCD P       This shows that the notion of inconsistency in possibilistic logic and its qualitative counterpart is gradual but global  The inconsistency level measures to what extent the knowledge base is inconsistent  but do not locate the inconsistency  The aforementioned  drowning effect  is a consequence of this global treat ment of inconsistency  One way to cope with it is to consider the knowledge base syntactically  Bre      Neb      BCD P      by selecting among maximal sub bases of KB using a criterion involving the a  s  However  these syntactical approaches do not have  yet  any semantics in terms of uncertainty measures  Now  using paraconsistent logics for handling incon sistent knowledge bases enables a local treatment of inconsistency  by locating the inconsistency on some formulas  Yet  these paraconsistent approaches do not allow for any graduality in the inconsistency  which im plies some loss of information if the initial knowledge was pertained with uncertainty  While possibilistic logic allows for a gradual but global treatment of inconsistency  where conflicts are solved only by comparing the uncertainty level of the pieces of information with the inconsistency level of the knowl edge base  the pure paraconsistent approach localizes inconsistency  but conflicts cannot be ranked accord ing to uncertainty  importance  priority  normality as done in rank based systems  Thus paraconsistency is not able to  solve  the conflicts  What we propose here is to apply the results of Section   to a given paraconsistent logic  namely C   daC      to handle both uncertain and inconsistent knowledge  and with a local treatment of inconsistency  We now give two motivating examples  one about fusion of uncertain information  multi source reasoning  and one about reasoning with default rules  Example    multisource reasoning  This example is borrowed from  Cho      Two witnesses report their observations about a mur derer  Witness    noted W   is certain that the mur derer was a woman with blond hair  and believes  with some uncertainty  that she was wearing a Chanel suit  glasses  and was driving a BMW  Witness    noted W   is certain that the murderer was a woman with brown hair and that she was not wearing glasses  and believes  with some uncertainty  that she was driving a Fiat   W  female  sure   blond hair  sure   drives BMW  unsure   wear glasses  unsure   wear Chanel sui t  unsure  W  female  sure   brown hair  sure   drives Fiat  unsure   wear glasses  sure    Possibility and Necessity Functions over Non Classical Logics  What would we like to conclude about the following statements    Both witnesses agree that the murderer was fe male and are completely sure  so we want to con clude the murderer was female     No contradiction either about wear Chanel suit since witness   does not know anything     Strong contradiction about the colour of the mur derer s hair  we wish to conclude neither blond nor brown but we want to keep in mind that these literals are  strongly subject to inconsis tency   knowing the constraint  blond hair    brown hair         Contradiction about wear glasses  the contradic tion is weaker than the one above since witness   is unsure  moreover  since witness   s information is prioritary to witness    s we would like to solve the conflict  by concluding wear glasses   Weak contradiction again  about the car  however  since both witnesses are equally certain  we do not want to conclude anything   Example     drowning effect  Here  applying Pearl s ranking procedure of default rules to          penguin          bird  penguin bird fly  b ird      wings          fly              A case study  C  necessity functions         The paraconsistent logic C   C   daC      is a paraconsistent logic  that is  a logic in which a contradiction  p      IP fails to entail other arbitrary contradictions   J       ljJ cl retains all infer ence patterns of classical logic that are not based on negation  For instance     IP    J   pi  is valid in C   By contrast  some inference patterns of classical logic that do appeal to negation are not preserved  For instance    J  IP     p V  I J  is not valid in C   The idea is that positive informa tion is fundamental  positive formulas and inferences contribute to state what the facts are whereas negative formulas and inferences are merely constraints  in the sense of integrity constraints for databases   Accord ingly  cl allows us to elicit all and only the formulas responsible for a given contradiction   CL      BL       A valuation based semantics for C   Alv     is given in Section       as we now reproduce the original ax iomatic presentation of C  that consists of the next ten axioms     p       J      p       p        J                   J      g ves                     penguin          bird  penguin      fly     bird      fly  bird      wings    Adding the fact penguin to     enables us to infer fly but wings is not deduced  it is  drown  by the incon sistency appearing at rank     This particular case of the drowning effect is known as the property of  in heritance blocking   Considering     as a set of formulas for the logic C   we obtain AU   penguin  f c   fly  fly  wings    Thus  we avoid the drowning effect but we do not take into account priorities  induced by specificity  such as penguin          fly over bird          fly and we conclude that fly is not well behaved  What we would like is to take advantage of the lo calisation of inconsistency  as done by paraconsistent entailment  and the priority between formulas  which would lead us to infer  fly  wings  but not fly  Note that prioritized syntax based approaches based on the selection of maximal consistent subsets of the knowledge base guided by the priorities solve the drowning effect but do not tell anything about where the contradictions are localized  so  for instance  the conclusion wear glasses is not relativised by the fact that it is  weakly  subject to inconsistency

   NxsMore generally  the minimum specificity closure could be extended to any logic L satisfying the property  P    Applying the principle of minimum specificity enables us to draw conclusions that taking into account the uncertainty and the inconsistency of the knowledge base  We propose the following definition of a conse quence relation   Definition  KB f       J iff Nxs     P      Nxs            Proposition     KB f     rP iff Nxs t     Definition  a C  possibility distribution is a mapping  r  We could have also defined C  possibility functions  C  necessity and possibility orderings  that we do not discuss for the sake of brevity  C  necessity functions are sufficient to deal with the next section  devoted to the application to reasoning with uncertain and incon sistent knowledge   as      is a Ct necessity function  since Ct obeys the condi tion stated in Proposition      the soundness of the semantics coming from the soundness and complete ness of C  established in  Alv           Nxs     j     Intuitively  we deduce    J from KB iff the certainty of    J is higher than the inconsistency inherent to    J  or equivalently  iff the certainty of  lj  is higher than the certainty of   The binary version of f    would be defined by if  f   KB    J iff Nxs t p        Nxs l      if    or equivalently iff Nxs t p        Nxs IP       CjJ   Note that f   is nonmonotonic  a more complete study of the properties of f    a Ia Kraus  Lehmann and Magidor  KLM      is possible with respect to the  monotonic  logic cl instead of classical logic  Note that when N collapses to a classical necessity measure  we haveVt  Nx     P     N   L  and f    is the classi cal possibilistic consequence relation  DP    b     Possibility and Necessity Functions over Non Classical Logics   multi source reasoning   let us return to the example of Section      Taking some a E            Example      W   witness     N female       N brown       N BMW    a  N Chanel    a   N glasses    u   W   witness     N female       N   brown       N   BMW   a  N    glasses       The fusion K B of these two knowledge bases gives the following minimum specificity closure    NKB female       NKB   female       NxB   female           NxB brown       NKs   brown      NxB   brown       NxB BMW  u   NxB   BMW   a  NxB Chanel   a  NKB Chanel       NxB Chanel        NxB glasses    a  NKB   glasses     NxB   glasses     a              Therefore  we have K B f    female  K B f    Chanel  KB f      glasses  however  KB lt  BMW  KB lt  BMW  K B lt  brown  K B lt    brown       Therefore  we have K B f    fly  which is intended   K B f      wings  which is intended   f    avoids the drowning effect  contrarily to the classical minimum specificity closure  System Z  and similar systems  but also K B f    live in Antarctica  which is not intended   Due to NKB fly        the rule fly    live in Antarctica applies   Here is a revised definition  more suited to handling default rules  Definition  Let K B   FULl  where F is a set of facts and Ll     Pi        i  i   l  n  a set of default rules  where each rule is assigned a necessity degree corresponding to its Z ranking  We define  G  Ll   FuLl and Vk         ck l Ll  F u    p          E Gk Ll  I NGk f     Pi    NGk f      pi   F u   Pi         E Gk Ll  I Gk Ll   r          k Ll   Then Ll f        iff Lastly  let G   Ll    n  oG kG   Ll   r                    Handling default rules  Example   Consider the fact penguin and the rules      penguin     bird  penguin     fly  bird      fly  bird      wings  fly      live in Antarctica   Applying the Z ranking procedure to Ll  written with the possibilistic ranking convention  gives the ranking   for any a   j  such that     j    a       penguin    bird  penguin        fly  fly       live in Antarctica   f     bird      fly  bird     wings    Lla     Then  taking the C  minimum specificity closure of K B    penguin  U  leads to      NxB penguin       NxB bird  u   NxB fly   a  NKB fly    live in Antarctica   a  NxB fly        NxB fly         NxB wings  j   NxB   live in Antarctica        NKB   bird      NxB   bird        NxB   penguin       NxB    penguin       NxB   wings     NxB wings        NxB live in Antarctica      NKB    live in Antarctica                   Example   We apply the usual ranking procedure       bird     fly  bird      wings  penguin      bird  penguin        fly  fly     live in Antarctica    G   Ll     penguin  bird     fly  bird    wings  penguin      bird  penguin        fly   Clearly  G   Ll    G       Therefore  Ll f    fly  Also  Ll r  bird and    f     wings  Contrastedly  Ll  live in Antarctica     Conclusion  We have given some basic results describing what re mains and what changes when switching from classi cal possibility theory to possibility theory over a non classical logic  We have then focused on a case study  namely the paraconsistent logic C   and showed how to use it to reason with inconsistent and uncertain infor mation  W hat has been left aside in this paper is the other possible applications of possibility theory over non classical logics  first  one could think of applying the general results of Section   to other non classical logics  for instance  introducing possibility and ne cessity valuations into intuitionistic logic could model gradual strengths of proofs  or  introducing them to Kleene s logic  or more generally to a multi valued logic  would enable us to handle both uncertainty and partial truth        Besnard and Lang  Another topic for further research would be a parallel study for other numerical theories of uncertainty  For instance  paraconsistent probabilities would lead to a more quantitative framework for reasoning with un certain and conflictual information  in this framework  noticing that Prob   p    Prob     p    Pro b   p v    p    Prob   pi     p        Prob     p   relaxing the constraint Prob     p       would make P r ob   p    Prob     p      possible for some formulas  then one could think of searching for the  least inconsistent  probability dis tribution satisfying a set of constraints  which could be useful for instance when rectifying a set of inconsistent probabilistic data
